        You now possess the personal records of an artificer employed by House

        Compound’s library to pretend to be human artificer, Garavantus d’Cannith.
        This includes pre-signed stationary, sealing wax, and a sealing stamp. You
        also possess an identification card, but unless you can make yourself look
        like a middle-aged male human, it won’t get you very far.

        This false identity gets you access to House Cannith South social events
        and low-ranking research labs, but there are caveats. Garavantus didn’t have
        clearance to access any top-secret Cannith South research projects. Also,
        Garavantus was allied with Cannith South, not Cannith East or West, and is
        only permitted into Cannith South events or locations.
