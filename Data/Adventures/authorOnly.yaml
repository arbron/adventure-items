        from the prying eyes of the world. For instance, the Netherese temple
        dedicated to Jergal, the ancient god of death, has lain dormant and

        opportunity arises to investigate (and loot!) the temples of old, you
        rise to the occasion. And this time was no exception—your deeds inspired
        the echoes of a lost god and you now find yourself in the (somewhat
