He hems and haws over the value, checking ledgers and showing you drawings of other pieces and what those pieces sold for in comparison. But he does not have to stall long; the assistant returns with a full company of the watch in short order. They even bring magical support.\n\n You spend the next three days in jail, as you plead your innocence and deny all knowledge that the brooch had been stolen from the Corymyrian Royal Vaults. Apparently, it was quite the theft. The most powerful divination magic of Cormyr’s famed wizard college failed to turn up any clues. But eventually your story checks out. The staff at Hofstead’s beacon confirm that a woman matching Talindra’s description was pulled from the wreck and went with the other survivors to Mulmaster.\n\n From Mulmaster the trail goes cold. No one there remembers seeing her, even though you spend several days and no small amount of gold trying to locate her. Even divination magic fails. She has slipped through your grasp for now. But the Cormyrian authorities remain wary of you and circulate your description.\n\n *When you get this story award, immediately deduct five downtime days and 25 gold pieces from your character. Until another story award instructs otherwise, you have disadvantage on all Charisma checks with Cormyrian officials.*\n\n **This is a Cormyrian Heist story award.**"

It represents adventurers’ interests in town and helps regulate the profitable exploration of the surrounding ruins.\n\n To initially join the Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon, a character must speak to Jotan Silverhammer, lieutenant guildmaster and volunteer sergeant of the Town Watch. There is no cost if you discovered the cause of the illness affecting the Old City, or if you obtain one of the **Local Pursuit** story awards, due to your substantial contribution to prosperity of the Old City. Otherwise, initial dues are 50 gp, with additional payments of 12 gp a month. These costs are waived, however, for volunteers either who work three shifts a month for the Town Watch. In game terms, this means a character must spend 50 gp to join, and to remain a member, whenever they spend downtime, they must spend an additional 4 gp for every 10 downtime days they spend (though you may be able to substitute downtime for this cost, see below).\n\n If a character who owes these dues fails to pay them as soon as they spend downtime, they must pay them by the end of their next game session or they lose all benefits of guild membership, and must pay the 50 gp initial dues again to regain them.\n\n Members of the Adventurers Guild may delve local ruins in search of treasure. They gain access to the **Guild Delving** downtime activity before or after any adventure set in Ylraphon."
