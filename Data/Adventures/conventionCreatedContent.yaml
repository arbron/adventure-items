        and sundry formidable scalawags of all races and vocations” (according
        to its charter). It represents adventurers’ interests in town and helps
        regulate the profitable exploration of the surrounding ruins.

         To initially join the Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon, a character must speak to Jotan Silverhammer, lieutenant guildmaster and volunteer sergeant of the Town Watch. There is no cost if you discovered the cause of the illness affecting the Old City, or if you obtain one of the **Local Pursuit** story awards, due to your substantial contribution to prosperity of the Old City. Otherwise, initial dues are 50 gp, with additional payments of 12 gp a month. These costs are waived, however, for volunteers either who work three shifts a month for the Town Watch. In game terms, this means a character must spend 50 gp to join, and to remain a member, whenever they spend downtime, they must spend an additional 4 gp for every 10 downtime days they spend (though you may be able to substitute downtime for this cost, see below).

         If a character who owes these dues fails to pay them as soon as they spend downtime, they must pay them by the end of their next game session or they lose all benefits of guild membership, and must pay the 50 gp initial dues again to regain them.

         Members of the Adventurers Guild may delve local ruins in search of treasure. They gain access to the **Guild Delving** downtime activity before or after any adventure set in Ylraphon.

      description: |-
        Captured by the enemy, you were subjected to horrific magical
        experiments that left you branded with arcane runes, and small throbbing
        shards of crystal embedded in your flesh.

        If you are hiding, these crystals alert NPC Red Wizards within 10 feet
        of your location to detect you automatically (as if they had succeeded
        on their Perception checks).

        You can spend 10 downtime days to have the pulsating crystal shards
        removed. Removing the crystals in this way removes the ability for Red
        Wizards to detect your presence, but leaves you with small superficial
        scars that cannot be healed, or disguised even by *disguise self* or
        similar spells.
