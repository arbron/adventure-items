  description: >-
    The legendary brewer, Vormestrand, has disappeared in pursuit of creating
    the finest beer Faerûn has ever tasted. While some believe that his rival,
    Zythos, may have had a role in his disappearance, the only clue is the
    recipe itself—something that Zythos really wants to get his hands on. It’s
    up to you to safeguard the recipe and finish the brewer’s work!

      description: >-
        The beer is little more than bitter water that barkeeps across the
        Moonsea ply their most drunken customers with in order to save the good
        stuff and make a little extra coin. While the tale of the brewing was no
        doubt exciting, linking your name to it won’t get you much respect from
        even the amateur beer enthusiasts.
    - name: Great Hooch!
      description: >-
        The beer is a rousing success, and many say that it has no equal in all
        of the Moonsea. You can expect to be treated quite well by connoisseurs
        and enthusiasts everywhere—if you can convince them you actually played
        a part in the brewing.
    - name: Mediocre Hooch!
      description: >-
        The beer is palatable and still better than your average swill. While it
        carries some distinctive flavors to set it apart from the rest, most
        people find the tale of its brewing to be more enjoyable than the beer
        itself.
