  name: Six Swords Out of Hell
  description: >-
    A prisoner with knowledge vital to the safeguarding of Faer√ªn is held in
    Maladomini, the seventh of the Nine Hells. Retrieving her is a blood-tinted
    guided tour of all of this plane has to offer.

    There are bargains to be made and infernal bureaucracy to be navigated in
    Grenpoli, the City of Politics. In Malagard, the imperfect monument, a
    melancholy lethargy threatens to overtake the weak. At Offalion, deadly
    brigades of devils train eternally to assault the mortal realms. Laughter
    and screams ring out in symphony from the barbaric playground of the Carnival
    Eternal.

    Waiting to welcome adventurers to all its sights are the Rulers of
    Maladomini themselves.
