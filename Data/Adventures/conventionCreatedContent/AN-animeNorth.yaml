    - name: Betrayed the School
      description: >-
        Your choices have made you a mortal enemy of the Swift Horse School and
        its Founder. They avoid you as best they can and are likely to retaliate
        against you with force should the conditions favor them. Perhaps one day
        you can redeem yourself in their eyes…
    - name: Blessing of the Ki-rin
      description: >-
        You have helped the Ki-rin and its allies on the Moonsea and it may see
        fit to bless you with celestial aid down the road. This can only happen
        if you once again elect to help the School of the Swift Horse.
    - name: Saved the School
      description: >-
        Having aided the school in a time of great need, you are welcome to stay
        with them for a time, come what may. If you spend **5 downtime days**
        training at Swift Horse, you train your spirit to make one future Wisodm
        saving throws with advantage, at which point this benefit disappears.

    - name: Goblin Folk Heroes
      description: |-
        Word of your deeds have been greatly exaggerated and spread throughout
        the Moonsea region. You have a reputation to help grease wheels…so long
        as the person you’re talking to listens to goblin folk tales.

        Once per adventure, when trying to draw on your reputation as a goblin
        folk hero to open doors, roll a d6. On odds, the creature being spoken
        to hasn’t heard the story. On a 1, the creature heard the story, but
        also heard an epilogue in which the prevailing adventurers ate gnomes
        at the victory celebration. The adventurer suffers disadvantage on the
        check to alter the creature’s perception.

        On 2 or 4, the creature has heard the story and is amazed to have a
        legendary adventurer in his presence. The hero gains advantage on social
        checks against the targeted creature.

        This story award is only good for adventures in the Anime North 2018
        CCC series.

    - name: Silver Snowflake
      description: >-
        For exemplifying the spirit of generosity and assisting Santa in a way
        no one else could, you’ve earned the Silver Snowflake. It is a small
        silver trinket that is always cool to the touch. When conversing with
        children, if you show them the silver snowflake and tell them that you
        know Santa, they will immediately believe you. This may make them more
        inclined to help you or answer questions honestly at the DMs discretion.
