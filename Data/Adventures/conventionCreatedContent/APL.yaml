      description: |-
        While not precisely as daunting as stealing from the horde of an Ancient
        Red Dragon, you did manage to sneak all the way into the feasthall of
        the Blue Bayou Bullywug before being caught, then talked your way out of
        a jam.

        Your success has given you the confidence to gain Advantage on the next
        three Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) checks made with nobles or
        persons of authority in the Moonsea area.
