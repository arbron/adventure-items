        Peacesmith training takes years, but after a few tendays study,
        meditation, and mentoring from the Paragon himself, you begin to
        understand the art of broadening peace. You may choose to spend 15
        downtime days and make a donation of 50 gold to the Peacesmith Guild to
        gain a **+2 bonus to one Charisma (Persuasion) check** to attempt to
        persuade a creature to stop fighting, or to otherwise help cause a
        peaceful resolution in a conflict. This ability recharges after a long

        At this player character’s touch the Peacestone did not glow. Any future
        attempts to touch the Peacestone yield the same results. The
        Peacestone’s behavior is mysterious, but does not prevent a person from
        broadening peace regardless of its illumination.

    When the party is hired to assist a covert organization, investigating the
    disappearances of Peacesmith, they are sent deep into the bowels of the
    town. It’s dirty work and the party certainly smells the stench of
    conspiracy (among other things). But after charging into a colossal mess in
    the Border Forest, they come face-to-face with the culprit.
