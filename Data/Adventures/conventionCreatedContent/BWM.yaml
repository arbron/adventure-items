  name: Howling on the Moonsea
  description: >-
    Aristocrats and nobles from all around the Moonsea come to vacation upon the
    pleasure barge that sets sail from the floating Sokol Sea Palace. However,
    recent late-night howling and frightening shapes in the dark have
    discouraged the usual number of customers from boarding the Sokol Sea
    Palace. Rumors of Zhentarim cargo ships being attacked by unseen monsters in
    Moonsea have also added to the fear of sailing to the once thriving vacation
    destination. Now, the Sokol family and their ferryman Karsk are turning to
    the recent job fair in Phlan to find a group of adventurers to investigate
    these alarming sounds and sights hoping to return their business to
    prosperity once more.

  description: >-
    The annual celebration of the abolishment of the Great Law of Humanity is
    happening in Hillsfar. As the leader of the factions in the region, Elanil
    Elassidil must attend the event, however, she has a guest with her. Elanil
    is looking after a young girl, who the adventurers may have met before, and
    has summoned adventurers to Elventree to watch over the girl while she is
    tending to the celebration. A simple babysitting task shouldn’t be too
    difficult for mighty adventurers, right?

    Under the Flooded Forest grows a toxic maze of magical fungi called the
    Nidus. From this horrid realm a cult has struck a terrible blow against the
    wood elves struggling to regrow the trees in the forsaken swamp of the
    Flooded Forest. The elves, on the brink of extinction, need the adventurers
    to navigate this deadly labyrinth and recover a precious object. But the
    tunnels here crawl with spore-laden beasts and demons, and the very air
    itself is poisonous.
