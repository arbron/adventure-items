    - name: Eye of Lolth
      description: |-
        A golden bracelet with a ruby magically suspended in the center is on
        the ground next to the him. No part of the ruby touches the bracelet. It
        seems to float in the gap between the gold. There’s writing in
        Undercommon on the bracelet, the *Eye of Lolth*. It reads: From the
        Demon Webs, Lolth sees all who scheme against Her.”
  
        This isn’t a magic item, but an item sacred to Lolth and her followers.
        It only exists in this adventure and cannot be attained for any future games.
  
        Characters will not be able to acquire the item and keep it. Lolth arranges
        for her minions of spiders to take the *Eye of Lolth* at the end of the
        adventure.

        If an adventurer puts a humanoid about to die giving birth to a
        Vhaeraun-touched drider out of his misery in this adventure, her sanity
        teeters. Whenever faced with a similar situation in the *Vhaeraun
        Touched* series, the DM is advised to describe the character’s struggle
        with her sanity.

      description: >-
        Adventurers who survive this adventure know how to tread cautiously
        through Vhaeraun-touched drider lairs and rescue allies trapped in
        Vhaeraun-touched drider webs. This may have great benefit in future
        *Vhaeraun Touched* adventures.
