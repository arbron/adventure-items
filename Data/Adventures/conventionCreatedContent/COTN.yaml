    - name: Faro’s Song
      description: >-
        You have spent time in the company of the constable of Stonedock, moreso
        that you can mimic the song Faro is known for humming. This song may
        sooth the fear-filled hearts and instill hope to those in despair. This
        innocent homage to this well-loved man may move the displaced and
        hopeless to action, possibly effecting the Red War or future Con of the
        North Convention-Created Content.
    - name: Stink of Thanks
      description: >-
        As a token of gratitude, the fishermen of Stonedock gift you a bucket of
        their special stinkbait. Each batch of this offal-smelling muck is a
        local mixture of rotten food staples, dead beast viscera, bubbling, vile
        fluids and a special ingredient that its maker adds to it! The bait’s
        stench is so putrid that many may avoid you while you have it, you might
        lure beings that enjoy this gut-churning grub to it, or it could serve
        you in other ways in future Con of the North Convention-Created Content.
