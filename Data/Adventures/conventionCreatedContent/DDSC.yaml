    With the repeal of the Law of Humanity, things have changed in the Hillsfar
    surrounds, and not necessarily for the better. The farming village of The
    Stop is no exception. The Red Plume Soldiers have withdrawn their presence
    and no one is left to maintain order. When things get out of hand, a noble
    representative of the people and the law is required.
