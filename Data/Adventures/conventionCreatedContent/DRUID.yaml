    The forest haven of Elventree is in peril! Children have been abducted,
    monsters have breached the town perimeter, and one of the village’s druids
    has gone missing. The local spring seems to be a source of these problems,
    and you must to descend into it to explore the caverns below. Are you a
    match for the threats beneath Elventree’s feet?

    - name: Token of the Withered Mother
      description: |-
        At the risk of your safety and sanity, you have acquired an iron token
        from an annis hag. The iron token is magically bound to you and all
        attempts to get rid of it prove futile—howsoever you try, the token
        reappears in your hand at the end of each long rest.
  
        So long as the iron token is bound to you, whenever the moon is at its
        fullest, you dream about receiving a visit from the Withered Mother who
        gave you the token. In the dream, the hag takes your head in her hands
        and plants a kiss on your cheek. When you awaken, your cheek smells of
        rancid spittle.
  
        Whenever you play one of the **DRUID** series adventures, you make all
        Charisma and Charisma-based skill checks at Disadvantage.
