    since the Great Law of Humanity has been abolished. Many non-humans like
    Bert have helped forge a new future for Hillsfar, but what is the current
    reality?

        Though nothing came out of the matchmaking efforts, Bert is none the
        less entertained by the characters assistances. It is likely their deeds
        today will pay dividend in the future.

  name: An Adventuring Party Walks Into A Bar
  description: |-
    There have been strange accounts from several of the heavier drinkers in
    Hillsfar; all are reports of monsters plaguing the woods near the city. Are
    these simply the ravings of those who have overindulged…or is there a more
    sinister plot to uncover? Your party is hired to go on a pub crawl and
    uncover any mischievous mixologists or spiteful servers in order to get to
    the bottom of these claims.
  
    There is no better drink than that of justice served!
  
    But adventurers should probably try them all, just to be sure…this is a pub
    crawl after all.

        One way or another, you resolved the dilemma with Sir Ardem Rohan and
        the boneclaw.
  
        - If Sir Ardem recanted his racist past and begged forgiveness, he may
        just be trying to save his own life. Nonetheless, you feel assured that
        others will follow his example.
        - If Sir Ardem was killed, despite Bert and Ranlynn’s pleas, you feel a
        bony, clawed fingertip brush against your cheek during your dreams every
        time you take a long rest. (This is not intended to have a mechanical
        effect, but characters earning this story award may face tangible
        consequences in future adventures.)

        a wooden staff with a glowing symbol of House Garaf (A werewolf face
        with the star of Selûne over it). If Speak with Animal is used to
        communicate with it, it says it is a wizard to the House of Garaf and
