  description: >-
    A disease is spreading around the town of Melvaunt, causing boils and
    festering marks to form on townsfolk and travelers alike. The local guard
    believes that this disease is of unnatural origin, and has issued a call for
    brave adventurers to investigate the matter. Can you find the source of the
    plague, or will you simply fall as another victim?

        Defeating Halgash within the 5 hour time limit or (using Divine
        Intervention) to save Alyssa will get you the friendship of Melvaunt’s
        City Watch. This may come in handy later on.

        If the players manage to spare Halgash and her tribemates, they earn
        this story award. Sparing Halgash has left her indebted to you. Only
        time will tell if she will return to aid you in a future adventure.

  description: >-
    Melvaunt’s guards are found dead in the barracks, the mark of an orcish
    murder god splattered on their walls. While the assassins are elusive, the
    Emerald Enclave has found a way to track them to their shadowy hold in the
    form of a strange hermit. Will the adventurers bring light to the situation
    or be lost in the dark?

      description: >-
        As thanks for killing Gnott, Tita Malas offers adventurers a tattoo that
        can tell the seasons. Adventurers who choose to accept gain a tattoo
        (characters can decide where on their body) of a balete tree that
        changes its appearance to match the current season (spring, summer,
        autumn, or winter) of the area they are in. Bearing this mark may have
        some bearing on future adventures.

        Defeating Gnott stops the servants of Shaargas from joining the main orc
        horde. No doubt this would have some effect on future adventures
        involving the battle to come.
