  name: Isle of Moss
  description: >-
    The City of Hillsfar has endured continuous chaos since the Rage of Demons.
    First Lord Vuhm Yestral dreamed of stability the day he took office. Five
    years later, the only real change is the number of grey hairs on his head.
    While xenophobia has reduced greatly, stability in the region is nowhere in
    sight. It has been a couple of months after the mighty beast was slain and
    Hillsfar is barely recovering of the major assault by multiple factions. Now
    rumors of Red wizards kidnapping farmers have spread across the city. What
    could the Thayans be up to this time? Part One of the *Mystery of the Isles*.
