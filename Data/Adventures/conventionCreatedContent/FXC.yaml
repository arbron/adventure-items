    - name: The Child Likes You
      description: >-
        You have a mark on you where the child touched you, and it glows with a
        white inner light. The child will always see you as a friend and as his
        hero.
    - name: Kobold Slayer
      description: >-
        By ruthlessly slaughtering kobold commoners, you have acquired the
        reputation of Kobold Slayer that is spreading throughout the Moonsea
        region. This reputation may serve or hinder you in the future. Kobold
        characters will no doubt react poorly in your presence (disadvantage on
        persuasion or deception checks, but advantage on intimidation checks).
    - name: Respect of the Pierced Snout Tribe
      description: >-
        By defusing the situation and negotiating the return of the child, you
        have earned the respect of Matron Tokni and the Pierced Snout tribe.
        Your future endeavours may lead you to another meeting at some point, in
        which case this story award could have an effect.
