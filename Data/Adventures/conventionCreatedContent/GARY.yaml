  description: >-
    In the shadow of the Galena Mountains, outside the Glumpen forest, the scars
    of the ancient war with the kingdom of the Witch King still lay fresh and
    exposed to the night air. A trade route between the regions of Vaasa and
    Damara have, through the years, created a crossroads at Aetherglen. The
    people who live there have an abiding honor for their dead, and the
    graveyards are shrines to their forebears. As you pass through, however, you
    are waylaid by a mysterious man who tells you that the dead are restless,
    and something worse may be stirring ‘neath the huge Gulthias trees of the
    forest.

    - name: Furrball the Skeleton Kitty Cat
      description: >-
        Furrball is a non-combat familiar. He qualifies as undead, but when
        threatened has an additional ability that allows him to enter the
        Ethereal Plane. This ability also allows him to be annoyingly underfoot.
        He demands food, even though he doesn’t eat, and demands pets and
        scratches behind his ears, even though he has no skin. Furrball is
        intended for flavor only and provides no advantages as a regular Wizard
        or Warlock familiar.

    An ancient Gulthias tree contains the answers you’re seeking to the
    questions of the ancient dead and the recently dying in the village of
    Aetherglen. Its roots are massive, but so is the massive echoing bole
    underneath the tree. Delving deeper on the well-traveled path, you discover
    an old Elven city, apparently carved and fashioned from the roots
    themselves. But, what you discover only leads to more questions and more
    danger. Do you dare to venture further, and deeper, into the darkness
    beneath the tree?

    Beneath the ancient Gulthias tree is buried an even older city of Elvish

    After exploring the city, you’ve found that there are strange passageways
    buried through the roots in the middle of common pathways, leading to a
    mirror city underneath. This city is suspended from the roots as the city it
    mirrors above is built on top of the roots. A darkness falls over this city,
    and you step carefully from root to root lest you fall into the deeper
    darkness below.

        **Note that magical effects itemized below only occur in *ccc-gary-xx*
        modules. Outside of *ccc-gary-xx* modules it qualifies only as found
        treasure worth what is listed below.**

        A purring voice whispers in your ear: “Mmmmmm…I live still…” You
        recognize this voice as the Witch Maiden. This must be her phylactery!

        You try and take off the crown, but it’s stuck on your head. As you try,
        you hear her laughter in the back of your mind.

        While you’re wearing this crown, you can summon a **Shadow** once per long
        rest. The Shadow will follow your commands and act on your behalf for 10
        minutes before it returns to the afterlife from whence it came. While it
        remains, you can communicate with it telepathically up to a range of 200’.

        While you’re wearing this crown, you can cast the cantrip *Message* at will.
        Unfortunately, the target of your message will hear the voice of the Witch
        Maiden delivering your information.

        While you’re wearing this crown, your Maximum Hit Points will fall by 1HP
        each day, immediately after waking from a long rest. If you are dropped to
        0HP due to this effect, you have died. You cannot be returned to the living
        unless the crown is removed from your body.

        The crown can only be removed by removing your head, or by a *remove curse*
        spell.

        The crown has a particularly evil cast to it, and you’ll only be able to sell
        it a vendor with a successful contested Deception check. If you can sell it,
        it is worth 2500gp.

        The crown can only be destroyed by dropping it into molten lava.
