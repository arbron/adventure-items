    Some heroes raid dungesons. Some heroes slay dragons. And some heroes raise

    fundraising gala at the Moonsea Children’s Hospital—until an uninvited guest
    and his aberrant entourage crash the party!

        You rubbed elbows with the nobility to benefit a worthy, charitable
        cause. Additionally, word has spread that you saved some of them from a
        horrible death at the hands of a madman. While in the Moonsea region,
        you are welcome in high society and other people of high birth treat you
        as a member of the same social sphere.
