  description: >-
    Cold, bleak, and unforgiving the river Styx winds through sheets of ice that
    comprise the layer of Stygia. An iceberg, drifting through the floe, bears
    signs of a sahuagin massacre. Sent to find a neutral third party, a clever
    devil asks the characters to investigate.
