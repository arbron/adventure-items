      description: |-
        You broke the laws of the black market. Because of this, you were
        captured by the Kroth Magg hobgoblins and punished.

        While most punishment involves serving backbreaking labor until
        one faints from exhaustion, the Kroth Magg are known to be inventive
        with their punishments, which includes events such as being stuffed
        into a burlap sack filled with rats and thrown in a pond, or forced
        to fight wyvern hatchlings barehanded to a jeering crowd.

        Somehow you survived and were released by the Glip Dak hobgoblins.
        The guards have more important things to deal with.

        Unless playing another Glip Dak adventure immediately after this one,
        **the next 5 downtime days you earn are automatically expended
        surviving your punishment**.

        Guard Captain Hrogar invites you to a private ceremony within the
        central hall of Glip Dak, a massive Netherese building of exotic stone.
        There he and other officers thank you for your service and discretion,
        awarding you Vadd Narkoz, “Strong Warrior,” in this private
        proclamation. The hobgoblins of Glip Dak acknowledge you as a worthy and
        trusted ally.

        For future Glip Dak modules, the adventurer has advantage on Charisma
        checks when interacting with Kroth Magg soldiers and guards.

    - name: In Your Debt
      description: |-
        You have successfully rescued the bodies of four unfortunate
        adventurers:

        - Yowen Kar of Clan Vallahir is a hill dwarf warpriest who acts
        suspicious of elves. He hides his care for others behind a hard
        demeanor. His current companions complain of his surliness.
        - Darius Dawnguard is a squire of the reborn Order of Dawnfire, a sect
        of Lathandar. He has made an oath to search for dangerous artifacts and
        dispose of them.
        - Vellona the Orphan made a pact with a mysterious entity after she fled
        into a forest after the destruction of her village. She seeks to unlock
        the magic in her blood to sunder this bargain.
        - Lalitha Dae’Danin is an elf noble and druid who dresses as a man to
        hide from an arranged marriage with a tyrannical and powerful high elf
        aristocrat.

        They express their enduring gratitude to you, some with tears and hugs,
        others (the grumpy dwarf) with a practical, gruff thank you of a job well
        done.

        Should you die during any Glip Dak adventure, these heroes will tirelessly
        search for you and have *raise dead* cast upon your body. You pay only the
        material component cost (as per the acolyte background). Once you are
        rescued once, the debt is paid, but the friendship remains.
    - name: Lost in Space
      description: |-
        You were inside when the Citadel of Vlaakith shifted into the Astral
        Plane. The Astral Plane is a bizarre realm, timeless and devoid of
        gravity and direction.

        You wander randomly throughout this surreal place, experiencing life
        beyond the Material Plane. Finally, you’re able to find a way back to
        Faerûn—but you’re required to spend 50 downtime days in the process.

        Yauch remains alive and active, plotting and preparing as he always has,
        but now he knows your face and has sworn vengeance against you.
  
        Because of Yauch’s thoroughness and foresight, adventurers have
        disadvantage on the first saving throw against a spell Yauch casts the
        next time they battle the duergar. This only occurs once.
    - name: Honor of the Kroth Magg
      description: |-
        While most of the civilized world views hobgoblins as no better than
        orcs or goblins, you have learned otherwise. While they can be cruel and
        tyrannical, there is also a deep honor and profound discipline to them.
        They seek to pay back all debts and they find lying to be beneath them.
  
        In future Glip Dak adventures, the heroes have advantage on Charisma
        (Persuasion) checks with the Kroth Magg, and goods 25 gp and under can
        be bought at half price in Glip Dak.
