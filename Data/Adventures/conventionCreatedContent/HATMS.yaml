    On the eve of Shieldmeet, the sunken Isle of Maos rises from the depths of
    the Moonsea, only to return to the water with the rising of the sun. But
    this year, the island does not sink beneath the waves, and destruction
    follows in its wake. A drunkard named Will Brightsong is somehow connected,
    and the adventurers must keep him alive long enough to find out why!

      description: >-
        The last scion of the Brightsong family has died, their purpose now lost
        to the world, which will suffer greatly for it.

        Or has it? You now bear the mark of the Brightsong family, a sigil that
        appeared on your inner left forearm. From the direction of the Moonsea,
        you faintly hear a tune, a song that you know from deep in your heart;
        one that will reveal its words when the time is right.

        You must travel now to the Moonsea, and sail to the Isle of Maos. There
        you will find your answers. There you will face the legacy the Brightsongs
        have left you.

        Every Shieldmeet, you must journey to the Moonsea and the Isle of Maos to

      description: |-
        You have done the unthinkable and read from the Al Azif. Though you have
        cast off the terrible tome, it has left its mark on you forever.

        You gain one of the following physical features:

        | d6     | Feature                                                                        |
        | ------ | ------                                                                         |
        | 1      | Your eyes are completely black.                                                |
        | 2      | You always smell faintly of rot.                                               |
        | 3      | When you speak, another voice seems to say the same words along with you.      |
        | 4      | A symbol has been branded somewhere on your body. It reads “VECNA” in Abyssal. |
        | 5      | Your orifices are always crusted with scabs and pus.                           |
        | 6      | Your skin appears as that of an aged corpse, grayed and flaking.               |

        Only powerful magic such as *wish* can remove the taint of the *Al Azif*
        from your body. Should you perish, and be brought back to life from magic
        such as *true resurrection* or *reincarnate*, the mark remains on your new
        body.

        This has no mechanical effect on the game.
