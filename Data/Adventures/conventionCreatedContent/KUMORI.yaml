        You stand amongst the trees of the Quivering Forest; the rustling of
        leaves is peaceful, soothing. Birds cheerily sing, sunbeams dapple your
        skin, and a cool breeze tickles your ears.

        do have any awareness, its presence seems to be one of contentment and
        gratitude for your assistance in bringing natural order back to the land.
