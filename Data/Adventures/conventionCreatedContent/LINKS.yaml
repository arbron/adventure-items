    A persistent ghost has been spotted in Phlan, flitting from building to
    building. The residents say that it stands in front of the Laughing Goblin
    every night, eyes wide and full of terror. If approached, it screams and
    disappears. In the wake of the town’s re-opening and the retreat of the
    thick winter fogs, peace must be returned before people leave for good.

      description: |-
        You have earned the enmity of an influential person in Phlan. Select
        from the following list:

        - Calypso
        - Marigold Butterleaf
        - Bitter-Blossom
        - Rooster Cinderelm
        - Regis Brightgem

        You have disadvantage on social checks with the noted person until you
        find a way to remove this story award.
    - name: Friend of Phlan
      description: >-
        You have performed a significant service for Phlan—and for Calypso, the
        new regent. She has marked you as an ally of the guard so long as you
        openly wear the pendant. This grants you advantage on social and
        investigation checks made in the presence of the town guard.
    - name: Reviled in Phlan
      description: >-
        If a character is unable or unwilling to pay the fine, Calypso makes it
        well known that they are not welcome in the city any longer. They must
        serve 30 days of hard time (downtime days; the character does not have
        to pay living expenses but can perform no other downtime activities
        during this time) before they are allowed to enter Phlan again.
        Furthermore, all social checks with Calypso, residents of Phlan, and
        city guards in any city in the Moonsea region are made at disadvantage
        until this story award is removed. Paying the 30 days of hard time does
        not remove this story award, but it does allow the character to re-enter
        the town.

    As winter releases its grip on the region surrounding the town of Phlan,
    secrets are revealed within Glumpen Swamp. Strange landscapes and sigils
    have been found beneath the mud, and the wildlife around the swamp has
    become greatly agitated. At times a spectral figure can be seen in the
    distance, only to disappear upon approach. Can you discover what is
    happening in the muck and gloom?

        You have freed Fulton Stormweather, an elf wizard that now resides in
        Phlan. You can spend two downtime days to travel to him and convince him
        to cast *legend lore* for you on an object. He can also provide the
        *identify* spell for free, but only once as his time in the feywild is
        preventing him from accessing the Weave as he once did.
