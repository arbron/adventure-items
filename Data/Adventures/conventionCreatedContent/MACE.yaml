        You have taken the Dawnsight as you did not return to the Winged Panther
        on time. In several days you go to look at the painting and it is
        missing. A note remains where the painting was. It reads: *“Thank you so
        much for helping my family. Sadly I really need this painting more than
        you. Safe travels dear friend. -P”*
