    - name: A Dapper Familiar
      description: |-
        Only a character with at least one level in warlock can gain this story
        award.

        You have made friends with Dapper the imp. If you have Pact of the Chain,
        you can summon Dapper as your imp familiar (no mechanical changes from a
        normal Pact of the Chain imp familiar). Dapper is a cheerful, three-eyed
        imp who loves to eat, and she tries to lick everything at least once just
        to see how it tastes. She is egotistical and self-aggrandizing, and once
        summoned by a warlock, she insists that she is the master and the warlock
        is her familiar.

    - name: Moonsea Liberator
      description: >-
        You helped lead the Welbers, a family of escaped slaves from Melvaunt,
        to safety out of Thentia. Because of your good deed, Edea Valkrana has
        welcomed you into the Moonsea Liberation Society and given you a small
        clay tile carved with the symbol of a pair of crossed feathers. Any
        slave or abolitionist who sees this symbol recognizes you as an ally.

        You have caught the attention of Etana, a powerful wizard from the

  description: >-
    Disappearing shipments, missing alchemists—and proven musical acts whose
    rehearsals sound terrible! Instead of showing off Thentia to potential
    trading partners and giving the locals something to celebrate, the pall over
    this year’s Magic and Gold Festival threatens to drive business to Melvaunt
    and give the locals a reason to riot.
