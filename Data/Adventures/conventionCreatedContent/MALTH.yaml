  name: The Jackal’s Justice
  description: >-
    The town of Elmwood has seen its share of tragedy, and somehow, things keep
    getting worse. While the town recovers from a devastating plague, the
    constable informs adventurers that the bodies of the dead have been
    disappearing. She believes the disappearances may be tied to a young woman
    known as the Jackal. If the Jackal is behind the disappearances, what does
    she want with Elmwood’s dead? The constable tasks adventurers with finding
    an answer to this question, and if necessary, with stopping the Jackal.
