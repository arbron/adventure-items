    The Moonsea Children’s Hospital is now open, and a small town has sprung up
    around Elua’s Lighthouse. The townsfolk share stories about strange
    occurrences in the area that they attribute to the fiendish creatures that
    escaped during the hospital’s benefit gala. Possibly it is all just rumors,
    but a peculiar and lonely child at the hospital may hold the answers.

        and wants to get out.

    The festival of Greengrass is fast approaching, and a scavenger hunt has
    been scheduled to take place that day in the town of Lighthouse, organized
    by a noble in nearby Hillsfar. Something more seems to be going on here
    though. Between a missing aide and overly competitive rival teams, this
    doesn’t seem to be your standard entertainment. But it’s only a game. Or is
    it?

    The Red War rages after the fall of Mulmaster. Refugees from Mulmaster are
    steadily spreading across the region, looking for a new beginning. In the

    Was it something you drank? Perhaps you were drugged. Whatever it was, it
    caused you to forget why you just woke up in the Cormanthor Forest with some
    fellow adventurers. Some entity is messing with you, and it’s your job to
    figure out who and why!
