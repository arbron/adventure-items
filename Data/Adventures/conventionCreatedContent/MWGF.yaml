  description: >-
    Recently, residents of the Moonsea have been accosted by undead rising from
    the depths of the waters. Not only lost pirates, but sea creatures, too. An
    old fisherman’s recurring dream could lead to an ancient oracle and an
    explanation. This is, if the party survives the journey.

        The Constellation offers to brand each adventurer with a special sigil—a
        large star.

        To anyone else, the sigil looks like a normal tattoo. However, when you
        look at it, you see the writhing and twisting tentacles of The Constellation.
