      description: >-
        Your scarred legs and odd gait, gained from being burned astride a
        remorhaz, are easily recognized by monks at the Monastery of the Yellow
        Rose as the mark of foolishness or lack of balance. You make Charisma
        (Intimidate and Persuasion) checks against those monks with
        disadvantage.
    - name: Wormspur
      description: >-
        Your boots are scarred and pocked with melted iron from destroyed
        wormspurs. Monks at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose recognize this as a
        sign of your remorhaz-riding prowess. You are more likely to gain entry
        to the monastery due to your prowess and you make Charisma (Intimidation
        and Persuasion) checks with advantage against monks who recognize your
        prowess.
