        At the end of the adventure the player can use the following downtime
        activity. The players can spend **ten downtime days** to wait for Elder
        Filaeren Xilofane to recover and to speak to him.

        Elder Xilofane, upon hearing of your effort to eradicate the source of
        the sickness that befell his people, has his faith in the alliance of
        elves and men bolstered.

        For Emerald Enclave affiliated players: If Xilofane has not committed
        to joining the Emerald Enclave, he does so now, accepting the pin and
        signing the letter of recruitment.

        For Zhentarim affiliated players: Xilofane convinces the gambler Durgin
        Lodepips to accept any offers to escort him back to Mulmaster. If the
        Zhentarim characters did not complete their faction assignment, they do
        so now.

        If the players spending downtime days in the above manner were not
        rewarded the Story Reward, “A Jar of Gratitude” during the adventures,
        then they are at this time.

        In addition, any player that uses this downtime activity is able to take
        advantage of the sanctity and seclusion of Sunboughs. You enjoy room and
        board at a Modest Lifestyle with no costs, and you can complete any
        **one** downtime activity (other than this one) at half the downtime day
        costs and expenses.

        Whether you use the activity to complete faction objectives or take
        advantage of the secluded locale to study, once you have used this
        downtime activity, you can no longer gain its benefit.

      description: >-
        The adventurer’s actions have saved the villagers of Sunboughs and
        strengthened ties between the Lord’s Alliance and the Sunboughs people.
        Each character is gifted a small jar of the coveted Sunbough Honey. They
        are told that since this batch has not yet settled, it will be some time
        before its true flavors can be realized. Until that time, having it in
        your possession will make for a “sweet” story piece and may bring the
        attention of curious others that wonder how YOU obtained it.

      description: >-
        The daughter of Filaeren Xilofane wraps a silk scarf around the neck of
        one player. The magenta-hued scarf looks gaudy, but it is stitched with
        golden thread. The Sunboughs Sigil of a woodland wreath with a honeycomb
        at its center is embroidered into the scarf. Being in possession of the
        scarf identifies its owner as a friend of the wood elves of the
        Sunboughs, which may come in handy in future adventurers in the region.

        Word of your transgressions in The Sunboughs “matter” have reached the
        ears of The Zors of Mulmaster. For the slight to their reputation, you
        and anyone in your party (while you are present) may find yourselves
        shunned by the Zors in any dealings you may have in the City of Danger,
        or in the Moonsea Region for that matter. Their influence is
        far-reaching…and they do not forget.

        Keeping your word, you promised not to reveal to anyone that Marilynth

        Agent Garz provides you an opportunity to shadow The Secret Police of
        Mulmaster. You spend many days observing The Hawks investigating crime
        scenes, conducting stakeouts on persons of interest and answering
        broadsheet reporter interviews on the The Council of High Blades edicts.

        The experience allows you to spend **5 Downtime Days** to gain Advantage
        on any **one** Intelligence (Investigation), Wisdom (Perception), or
        Charisma (Deception) Checks. You can do this **once**.

        You did also learn that The Hawks change their tactics and techniques
        frequently, so once you used what you have learned, it will no longer
        be effective. Agent Garz apologizes as you **remove this Downtime Activity
        from your log**.
