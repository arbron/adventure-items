    The dawn of the final day arrives: The Red War looms on the horizon, and
    nothing can stop what is to come. But in those early hours before carnage
    begins, a group of adventurers are tasked with a covert operation to remove
    sensitive information left behind by the factions and sow subterfuge. Will
    internal and external influences keep them from completing their missions?

      description: |-
        The Hightower family has recognized your deeds and your aid to one of
        their own and have bestowed upon you a signet ring marking you as an
        ally.

        While this will have little bearing on most encounters, having such an
        item on hand might prove useful in future encounters with Lords’
        Alliance agent who know the family, and the Hightower’s themselves.

  name: Feast of the Moon
  description: >-
    Festivals galore line the streets, parks, and courtyards of Thentia. It is
    the Feast of the Moon, and all are gathered to remember loved ones and
    friends that have departed this world, and to pay homage to their ancestors.
    At a celebration in the Brambles, followers of Kelemvor host a stage where
    revelers tell tales of heroic deeds of their lineage. When one tall tale
    gets out of hand, the city itself may pay the price.
