    Once an ennead, the Earthspur Mines are home to a competition between many
    dwarves. Each clan sends its best and brightest crafter to compete in a test
    of endurance and skill. While a time of celebrating and companionship
    between clans, it is also a time of treachery and deceit, as each tries to
    sabotage the others. Unfortunately for Riswynn Rumnaheim, her clan has
    nearly died out, and is unable to watch her back, nor can she trust her
    closest friends at this fraught time. So she has placed a call for
    adventurers, and you have answered.

      description: >-
        You have received a challenge coin marking you as a friend of the
        Citadel of the Raven. It bears the markings of the Citadel on one side
        of this golden coin, and the symbols of both the Zhentarim and your
        faction on the other. For members of the Zhentarim, it just holds a
        singular flying snake. When traveling in the area, showing the coin
        will, under most circumstances, grant you access to the Citadel and
        services provided at their regular cost (instead of the 25% markup for
        outsiders), as well as a night of protection inside its walls, including
        a bed in the barracks. Up to six companions may accompany you into the
        Citadel on the strength of your word guaranteeing their good behavior.
        In the event of any member of your party violating this good conduct
        oath, you will be stripped of this coin (and any others you and your
        companions have on you) and cast out into the cold.
    - name: Chaotic Blessing of the Queen of Spiders
      description: |-
        You have drawn the attentions of Lloth to you, and she has noticed your
        prowess in battle. In recognition for slaying the mind flayer
        masquerading as one of her *beloved* driders, she has granted you a
        blessing, but you hardly feel blessed by it. What effect this has on
        your future adventuring career remains to be seen.
  
        Additionally, sometimes when you sleep or trance, you have dreams or
        visions of spiders bursting forth from beneath your skin, demons eating
        you alive, or your loved ones turning into half-spider monstrosities,
        but at the end of the vision or dream, you always feel the cool press of
        Lloth’s lips against your forehead again and you briefly feel that
        everything will be okay before jerking awake with horror in your eyes.
        A *remove curse* cast at 9th level or a *wish* can end this effect, as
        can a successful Divine Intervention by a deity not allied to Lloth. At
        that point, you should strike through this paragraph, but retain the
        first one.

        What did you do with this tome?

        - *Gave it to someone else*: That’s really sad.
        - *Kept it*: Congratulations! You have a dense, academic tome on the
        study of the elements and their impact on reality. Wandering about,
        adventuring, dungeon delving–not really all that conducive to studying,
        are they? Perhaps you should keep this at the bottom of your pack until
        you need a unique book to get in somewhere, like Candlekeep. Void this
        award if you ever give up the book.
        - *Gave it to Rastol Shan*: Shan is delighted with your gift, and offers
        to let you study the tome with him. For every 10 downtime days you spend
        studying the tome with him, he is able to produce a spell scroll of one
        level of spell from the *Elemental Evil Player’s Companion* and give it
        to you. If you choose to instead wait, multiple units of 10 days can be
        combined for higher level scrolls. After 60 days of study, Shan
        unfortunately has no more time to examine the book. During your study
        with him, you are expected to look and act the part of a respected
        researcher, so you must maintain a wealthy lifestyle, at a minimum.
