    The Gommurg Clan rarely deal with outsiders. These hill dwarves have
    isolated themselves for centuries to work on their craft and guard an
    ancient and sinister structure. Unfortunately, the world around them does
    not rest easy. An exile of the clan has inadvertently brought terrible woes
    to his ancestral home, and now he frantically seeks help to save his people.
