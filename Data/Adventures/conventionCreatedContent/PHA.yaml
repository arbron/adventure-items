  name: Six Summoned Swords
  description: >-
    A chance encounter on an unassuming road leads to a dangerous and lucrative
    opportunity. But what seems simple on the surface turns out to be much more
    below. Thrust into a world where every enemy has an enemy and everyone has
    their own dark motive, the only chance to survive is to ally with the right
    foe. Sometimes “doing the right thing” comes only in shades of black.
