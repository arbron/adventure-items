  name: 'Lost Holy Man: Portal Chase through Maladomini'
  description: >-
    The devils of the Maladomini have extended their reach into the conflict
    on Avernus. Baalzebul is scheming to steal the souls of Elturel for
    himself. If the characters have already finished Avernus, then Baalzebul
    wants to take the souls that Zariel failed to bring into the hells. If
    not, he wants to steal the souls promised to Zariel in some way but
    needs to better understand the contract that binds their souls to her
    service.
