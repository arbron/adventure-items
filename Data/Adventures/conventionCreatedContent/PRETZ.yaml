        You have entered the Manor without securing permission from Constable
        Hobb and have been arrested for breaking and entering. You spend a day
        in lockup and do some minor community service before being released from
        the constable’s charge. Glister law enforcement will be wary of your

        additional task in the future to clear your name completely.
