  description: >-
    The factions have heard murmurings of a new cult rising from the ashes of
    the obsessed dragon and elemental evil factions that they have dealt with in
    the past. This time, though, they seem to have an even more apocalyptic
    goal. A deep gnome informant claims the cult is dabbling with dangerous
    magic, but he, too, may have his own agenda

    - name: Favor of Boddynock Glitterstone
      description: >-
        Having spent time in the company of accomplished bounty hunter Boddynock
        Glitterstone, you have learned a thing or two about the history and
        efforts of the four major Elemental Evil cults that have been active in
        the regions through which you adventure. Boddynock reveals to you the
        location of a still functioning secret elemental node (air or water, PCs
        choice) near the Moonsea which you may travel to between adventures
        (spending 10 downtime days and the associated lifestyle costs).
        Travelling to a water node will allow a character to recharge a weird
        tank while traveling to an air node will allow them to recharge a
        balloon pack, storm boomerang, and/or wingwear (1 per day). In addition,
        you gain advantage on Intelligence (History) checks relating to any two
        of the following Elemental Evil cults: the Black Earth, the Crushing
        Wave, the Eternal Flame, and/or the Howling Hatred.
    - name: Learn the Culture (Mulmaster)
      description: >-
        You may spend 5 downtime days (and the associated lifestyle cost) in
        Mulmaster touring the city and learning the history of the region. You
        gain advantage on any single ability check relating to Mulmaster, the
        Brotherhood of the Cloaks, the cults of Elemental Evil, or the Red
        Wizards of Thay or on any single attack against an elemental or undead
        creature. Once the advantage benefit has been used, you may return to
        Mulmaster every time you gain a level and perform this quest again by
        spending the required downtime and lifestyle expenses.
      type: downtime
    - name: To Wear the Cloak
      description: >-
        If your character is a spellcaster, Zora Culkin has offered to sponsor
        your admittance into the Brotherhood of the Cloak due to your service to
        the city of Mulmaster. Though joining the Cloaks is mandatory for any
        arcanists seeking to stay in Mulmaster for an extended period of time,
        and sponsorship is not required, Zora Culkin’s sponsorship will
        definitely have its perks.
