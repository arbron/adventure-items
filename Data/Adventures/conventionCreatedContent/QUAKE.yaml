  description: >-
    During the Red War, you’ve been asked to deliver a mysterious wooden box
    labeled “Thayan Peace Keeper” to a group of legendary heroes inside
    Mulmaster. But the heroes never show up. A case of mistaken identity only
    further complicates what was supposed to be a simple mission—while the clock
    is ticking.
