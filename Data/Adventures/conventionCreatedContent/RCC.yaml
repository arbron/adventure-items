  description: >-
    Thorin Ironcap has journeyed from his home in Mithral Hall to the Moonsea in
    search of his missing brother, Thoradin, who was exiled from Mithral Hall
    for blacksmithing experiments deemed “too risky”. Rumors exist that he is in
    Melvaunt, and that he had been using the forges in the city before
    disappearing recently. Thorin needs adventurers to find Thoradin before his
    experiments cost his brother his life…or worse!

    - name: Cryptic Whispers
      description: >-
        Even though creatures transformed into stone cursed are long dead, a
        vague whisper of their memories lives on in the fist-sized obsidian
        skull embedded within the stone cursed’s body. Those who claim one of
        these skulls from a slain stone cursed often hear its whispering in
        their thoughts. While mostly the nonsensical ramblings of a tortured
        soul, the whispers occasionally (at the DMs discretion) offer up
        worthwhile information. However, these rare nuggets of guidance are not
        without a price. Those who carry a stone cursed’s skull for an extended
        period of time can begin to whisper to themselves on a regular basis and
        often find it difficult to focus on complex tasks.

        ***Note.*** While a DM may choose to provide information based on the
        skull’s whisperings, this story award is primarily for roleplaying
        purposes.

      description: |-
        You openly carry the black-bladed scimitar called Night Cutter, which
        once belonged to a respected drow captain of House Rakarn. Unless your
        race is drow, you are considered unworthy by most drow to carry it, and
        they take an instant dislike to you, treating you as a usurper.

        If your race is drow, or if you do not openly carry the weapon, this
        drawback does not apply to you.

        Lord Casplardann has awarded you a Grant of Arms, allowing you to place
        “Lord” or “Lady” before your name and legally display your heraldic
        crest on a shield or banner. While in Thentia, people are inclined to
        think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people
        assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make
        every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other
        people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. In
        addition, you can secure an audience with a Thentian noble if you need
        to.
