    While attending the first annual Reclamation Day Festival in Phlan, a

    benefactor, who seeks their help in ridding the southern ruins of Zhentil

      description: |-
        You have proven yourself an ally to not only your own faction, but to
        those who banded together to fight the necromancer, Marzellus Marshward.
        You are always welcome at the Waypoint Bindery, on the northwestern
        shore of the Moonsea. In addition, you can use the Waypoint to pass word
        on to your faction, even if your faction representative it not present
        at the time, and messages will be passed to you should they arrive but
        your faction contact is not currently at the bindery.

        Finally, Krenez, the founder of the Waypoint, will always have a bed and
        a meal for you should you need it, free of charge.
