  description: >-
    Recent goblin attacks near the outskirts of Hulburg prompted Lord Eorl
    Hulmaster to send a band of mercenaries into the foothills of the Galena
    Mountains to thin out their numbers. It was supposed to be an easy task, but
    it ended in disaster. The band’s leader remains trapped in goblin territory
    with their chieftan as his prisoner. Lord Hulmaster now needs skilled
    adventurers to retrieve the mercenary and his captive before it’s too late.
