  description: >-
    After the first expedition to locate an ancient tomb was prematurely ended
    by monsters, the Search and Locate Treasure Consortium is doubling down.
    Camp established, they are looking for adventurers to make their dreams come
    true, but the leader of the Consortium is hiding something. Will the
    characters be able to avoid the Man Slayer tribe that destroyed the first
    expedition, help Larazmu settle his internal struggles, and locate the tomb
    that they have been searching for without getting into Moor Trouble?

  description: >-
    Beneath the moorlands of Thar, hidden from all for centuries, lies the
    Broken Halls of Goldahroud. It seems to have been inhabited until recently
    as the blood marks on the walls are only a few weeks old. What mysteries lie
    beyond the doorway from the Tomb of Kered? Fear of the markings have forced
    the SALT Consortium to turn again to hiring adventurers to face what horrors
    await them in the Broken Halls of Goldahroud.
