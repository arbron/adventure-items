    The mining town of Glister has a problem. The latest caravan only arrived
    with a part of its supplies. Orcs waylaid them, took much needed goods, and
    are now making demands that the town return an artifact that is theirs, but
    the town is unfamiliar with. Help track down information about this artifact
    and possibly defend the city from an orc invasion!

    The mining town of Glister is under siege. Unprepared and short of supplies,
    the siege threatens to starve out the town. The mine has provided the only
    path that may provide some help; a collapsed tunnel has revealed an unknown
    cave that runs deep into the mountain.
