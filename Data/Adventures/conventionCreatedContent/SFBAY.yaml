      description: |-
        Talindra’s Brooch is an exquisite piece of artwork. A silver dragon
        curls around a piece of amethyst. A fleck of ruby is set in the dragons
        eye, a circle of gold enclosing the whole piece. It is a piece of
        jewelry fit for Cormyrian royalty. They will be very glad to get it
        back.

        The jeweler to whom you sought to sell the piece to immediately closes
        his shop and sends out his assistant while he appraises the piece. He
        hems and haws over the value, checking ledgers and showing you drawings
        of other pieces and what those pieces sold for in comparison. But he
        does not have to stall long; the assistant returns with a full company
        of the watch in short order. They even bring magical support.

        You spend the next three days in jail, as you plead your innocence and
        deny all knowledge that the brooch had been stolen from the Corymyrian
        Royal Vaults. Apparently, it was quite the theft. The most powerful
        divination magic of Cormyr’s famed wizard college failed to turn up any
        clues. But eventually your story checks out. The staff at Hofstead’s
        beacon confirm that a woman matching Talindra’s description was pulled
        from the wreck and went with the other survivors to Mulmaster.

        From Mulmaster the trail goes cold. No one there remembers seeing her,
        even though you spend several days and no small amount of gold trying
        to locate her. Even divination magic fails. She has slipped through
        your grasp for now. But the Cormyrian authorities remain wary of you
        and circulate your description.

        *When you get this story award, immediately deduct five downtime days
        and 25 gold pieces from your character. Until another story award
        instructs otherwise, you have disadvantage on all Charisma checks with
        Cormyrian officials.*

        **This is a Cormyrian Heist story award.**
    - name: Language Tutor Corbin Tusslefoot
      description: |-
        Corbin Tusslefoot, traveler and linguist owes you his life. In
        gratitude, he will suspend his travels and waives his usual fees to help
        you learn a new language. Corbin speaks and can tutor you in Dwarvish,
        Elven, Giant, and Draconic.

        Normally it costs 250 downtime days to learn a new language. With the
        help of a language tutor you may learn a new language by spending only
        200 downtime days. Alternatively, if you already have another means of
        reducing the number of downtime days required to learn a language, such
        as a faction benefit, you may reduce the cost by 25 days. You may use
        multiple language tutors to reduce the cost of learning a language, but
        each tutor may only help you learn a particular language once. If you
        earn multiple copies of a particular language tutor award, that tutor
        may help you learn one new language for each instance of the award you
        have. Use of a language tutor story award may not reduce the cost to
        learn a language to less than 100 downtime days.

        *The Ashen Scar* is considered a Mulmaster adventure for purposes of

        Instead of worrying about the punishments for using magic, arcane casters
        may choose to join the Brotherhood of the Cloaks. Characters that do so
        must swear to defend the rule of the High Blade, protect Mulmaster from
        the incursion of arcane magic and uphold the Edict of Arcane Banishment.
        Being a Cloak costs the character 3 Downtime Days per Mulmaster adventure
        played, and the character must maintain a wealthy lifestyle for that downtime.

        Joining the Cloaks is not without its benefits. All Cloaks receive a
        square medallion that denotes membership in the Brotherhood. This
        medallion gives the character advantage on social skill checks made with
        officials of Mulmaster (DM’s discretion). For each Mulmaster adventure
        played, the character gains one rank in the Cloaks organization. For each
        To Wear a Cloak favor the character has, he or she also gains an additional
        rank.
