  description: >-
    In a smoky tavern in the frontier town of Ylraphon, a drunken sailor cries
    in her beer. Befriending a group of adventurers, she confesses that she saw
    her spouse with someone else, and she worries what may come of it.
    Beseeching the adventurers to help her, the sailor asks them to investigate
    to find if her fears have come true, or if it is all a simple
    misunderstanding.
