  name: Who Pulls the Strings
  description: >-
    Pursuing the murderers of the nephew of a prominent noble house has revealed
    more than a simple random crime. A new group or faction has risen from the
    ashes and dust from destruction of Mulmaster, and its nature and intent
    still unknown. The leader of the Silver Skulls is a mystery, and perhaps a
    threat to what little stability Mulmaster has found since disaster struck.
