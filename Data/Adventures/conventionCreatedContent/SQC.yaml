        Clad in shinny plate armor, this adorable squirrel is often seen holding
        what appears to be an acorn. However, upon closer inspection, one will
        notice it is holding a 20-sided-die.

        If killed or reduced to 0 hit points, The Crazy Squirrel can be recalled
        via *find familiar*, and uses the statistics of a **cat** from the
        *Monster Manual*. It has proficiency in all gaming sets. The shinny plate
        armor has no effect on the Squirrel’s AC.
