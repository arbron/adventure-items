    - name: Ylraphon Adventurers Guild

        The Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon is a loose-knit league of
        “dungeoneers, tomb-robbers, errant crusaders, swashbuckling mercenaries,
        and sundry formidable scalawags of all races and vocations” (according
        to its charter). It represents adventurers’ interests in town and helps
        regulate the profitable exploration of the surrounding ruins.

        To initially join the Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon, a character must
        speak to Jotan Silverhammer, lieutenant guildmaster and volunteer sergeant
        of the Town Watch. There is no cost if you discovered the cause of the
        illness affecting the Old City, or if you obtain one of the **Local Pursuit**
        story awards, due to your substantial contribution to prosperity of the
        Old City. Otherwise, initial dues are 50 gp, with additional payments of
        12 gp a month. These costs are waived, however, for volunteers either who
        work three shifts a month for the Town Watch. In game terms, this means a
        character must spend 50 gp to join, and to remain a member, whenever they
        spend downtime, they must spend an additional 4 gp for every 10 downtime
        days they spend (though you may be able to substitute downtime for this
        cost, see below).

        If a character who owes these dues fails to pay them as soon as they spend
        downtime, they must pay them by the end of their next game session or they
        lose all benefits of guild membership, and must pay the 50 gp initial dues
        again to regain them.

        Members of the Adventurers Guild may delve local ruins in search of treasure.
        They gain access to the **Guild Delving** downtime activity before or after
        any adventure set in Ylraphon.

        Pursuit: Part-Time Taverner (Name of Tavern)”*). If you wish, you can
        write down the same tavern name as other characters who take this story
        award, making them some of your partners. Immediately before or after an
        adventure set in Ylraphon, you can spend up to 10 downtime days tending
        to your business, making use of the “Running a Business” downtime
        activity described on page 129 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*, with a
        maintenance cost of 2 gp per day for your share of expenses. In
        addition, if you purchase a meal or drink in Ylraphon during an
        adventure, the price you pay is never higher than the normal price
        listed in the *Player’s Handbook* (this does not affect lifestyle
        expenses).
    - name: Ylraphon Adventurers Guild
      description: |-
        The Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon is a loose-knit league of
        “dungeoneers, tomb-robbers, errant crusaders, swashbuckling mercenaries,
        and sundry formidable scalawags of all races and vocations” (according
        to its charter). It represents adventurers’ interests in town and helps
        regulate the profitable exploration of the surrounding ruins.

        To initially join the Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon, a character must
        speak to Jotan Silverhammer, lieutenant guildmaster and volunteer sergeant
        of the Town Watch. There is no cost if you discovered the cause of the
        illness affecting the Old City, or if you obtain one of the **Local Pursuit**
        story awards, due to your substantial contribution to prosperity of the
        Old City. Otherwise, initial dues are 50 gp, with additional payments of
        12 gp a month. These costs are waived, however, for volunteers either who
        work three shifts a month for the Town Watch. In game terms, this means a
        character must spend 50 gp to join, and to remain a member, whenever they
        spend downtime, they must spend an additional 4 gp for every 10 downtime
        days they spend (though you may be able to substitute downtime for this
        cost, see below).

        If a character who owes these dues fails to pay them as soon as they spend
        downtime, they must pay them by the end of their next game session or they
        lose all benefits of guild membership, and must pay the 50 gp initial dues
        again to regain them.

        Members of the Adventurers Guild may delve local ruins in search of treasure.
        They gain access to the **Guild Delving** downtime activity before or after
        any adventure set in Ylraphon.
