  storyAwards:
    - name: Favor of the Harpers
      description: >-
        You have earned the personal debt of a High Harper. The next time you
        visit Phlan, Malkyn invites you to a banquet in your honor at his
        estate.

        In addition, Malkyn gifts you with a letter of introduction, marking
        you as an honored ally of the Harpers, which may aid you in future
        interactions with the Harper Faction.
    - name: Prisoner of Thay
      description: |-
        Captured by the enemy, you were subjected to horrific magical
        experiments that left you branded with arcane runes, and small throbbing
        shards of crystal embedded in your flesh.

        If you are hiding, these crystals alert NPC Red Wizards within 10 feet
        of your location to detect you automatically (as if they had succeeded
        on their Perception checks).

        You can spend 10 downtime days to have the pulsating crystal shards
        removed. Removing the crystals in this way removes the ability for Red
        Wizards to detect your presence, but leaves you with small superficial
        scars that cannot be healed, or disguised even by *disguise self* or
        similar spells.
