    - name: The Green Man’s Ire
      description: |-
        You disobeyed the Green Man and slew the linnorm of the Flooded Forest.
        When the treant yelled, “You’ll have no friends of land, sea, or air
        until you leave my wood”, you felt the tree’s anger.

        You failed to accomplish the Green Man’s quest and have made enemies
        out of the ancient treants of the Flooded Forest.

        This story award could have an effect in a later adventure.
