  name: Those That Dwell Beneath
  description: >-
    In ruins near the city of Thentia, grungs have been trying to build a portal
    where they could move slaves in secret from the city of Melvaunt. But
    something sinister took hold of them, trapping them in the darkness. A map
    of the ancient city, which once stood on the surface of the land, leads the
    adventurers deeper into the catacombs. But will they find glory and riches?
    Or horror and death?

    - name: Friend of the Baucha Tribe
      description: >-
        You saved the darklings fleeing the monstrous cave fisher, and acted
        with friendship after. Should your paths cross again, you are hailed as
        an ally of the Baucha [BOU-ka] tribe of darklings, and have advantage on
        non-Intimidation Charisma ability checks when interacting with them. If
        you attempt to use Intimidation on a member of the Baucha tribe, this
        story award is removed.
    - name: You Made Matthew Cry!
      description: |-
        You revealed the horror of his undead life to Matthew, an innocent child
        lost in the subterranean city of Yrisgow. His weeping haunts you, even
        in your dreams. Each time you long rest, make a DC 12 Charisma saving
        throw. On a failed save, your attacks, skill checks, and saving throws
        suffer a -1 penalty until you take another long rest, and succeed on the
        subsequent saving throw.

        A *remove curse* spell will cause the weeping to fade in 1d4-1 days.
        Further investigation into the ruins of the city may reveal another method
        to make Matthew stop haunting you. (Play through **CCC-THENT01-03**,
        *The Dreaming Relic*, for further details.)

        Even when deafened, you can hear the sad wailing. You can gain no respite
        from Matthew’s sorrow.
