        You were able to locate Elanil, but were unable to save the inhabitants
        of Hilltop. The aberrants escaped with their treasure hoard and their
        prisoners before you were able to encounter them. Elanil is upset with
        you that you were not organized enough with your time or resources to
        stop them in time.

        Until you play in an adventure with Elanil and successfully complete a
        faction mission, you have disadvantage on all charisma based ability
        checks with all the factions. Once the extra renown is earned, remove

        differences are seen. For example, a finger might become a tentacle, or
        your shadow moves erratically behind you. These changes cannot confer

  description: |-
    Old pirates tell an aged tale of a black dragon attacking merchant ships
    sailing the Moonsea. The beast was slain, or so they thought. Recently,
    merchant ships have been attacked, and they say the culprit was a black
    dragon. The beast may fly away with a few victims, but it leaves the rest to
    fend for themselves in the Moonsea.

    Could this be the same creature from before? Can the adventurers slay the
    dragon and bring peace to the waters of the Moonsea?

    - name: Mark of the Dead
      description: |-
        Either Abigail or Peaches explains that Captain Dread Red offers to
        tattoo each party member with the mark of his crew (the symbol for this
        adventure saga). If they agree, a jittering zombie with long, white
        hair, a bulging and blind right eye, and a wooden peg leg staggers up to
        them carrying a tattoo kit: a small hammer, a needle that resembles an
        icepick, and a bottle of black ink.

        The tattoo process isn’t painful, the design is clean, and it can be
        placed anywhere on the body.

        The Mark of the Dead may grant a character special conditions in future
        Dead Men’s Tales adventures.
