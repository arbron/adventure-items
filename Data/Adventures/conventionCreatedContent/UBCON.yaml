    The adventurers are rescued from a sinking ship by a group of Moonsea Region
    town guards who need heroes. Their villages are cursed by a plague. Luckily,
    they know of a fabled island, the Realm of the Brand, where ancient healers
    can concoct healing potions for diseases just by descriptions. Unfortunately
