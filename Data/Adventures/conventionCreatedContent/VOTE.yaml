  description: >-
    Jeny Greenteeth again needs the help of adventurers, and this time, she is
    willing to pay a large price for their help—restoring the pact between Phlan
    and the fey of the Quivering Forest. All she needs is a coin from a dragon
    hoard. Easy enough, right? You may change your mind when you hear the name
    of the dragon…

    - name: 'Banned: Stygia'
      description: |-
        The frozen, inhospitable wilderness of Stygia is home to many vile
        creatures as well as an uncountable number from the Material Plane.
        Desperate criminals and those condemned to death may pray to Levistus,
        the ruler of Stygia, for freedom; should he answer, they are transported
        here. For reasons known only to you and him, you are forever banned from
        setting foot within Stygia. Perhaps you redeemed too many souls, or
        maybe you were discovered to be in league with Geryon, the former ruler
        of this realm; regardless, Levistus has closed this later of the Nine
        Hells to you. You can’t participate in further adventures in this place.

        A character with this story award may visit other areas of the Nine Hells
        but has been banned from Stygia.
