        body. The mark is a small black handprint roughly three inches by two
        inches in size. Whenever you are presented with an opportunity to act in
        a manner that aligns with Bane’s tenets of fear, hatred, or tyranny, the
        mark itches and burns. Whether you view this as a sign to fight against
        Bane’s beliefs or treat it as a call to honor his teachings is up to
        you.
