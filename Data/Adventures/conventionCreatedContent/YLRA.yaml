        Great misfortune caused you to be trapped and locked away in an eldritch
        amber prison controlled by the ancient entity called the Tree of Doors.
        You remain there, alive but in a death-like hibernation, until you are
        rescued by members of the Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon. Spend **20
        downtime days** to wait until you are rescued. If you do not have the
        downtime days to spend, you are still eventually freed, but whenever you
        earn downtime during any future adventure, it is immediately spent
        towards repaying the downtime cost of this story award, until you have
        spent a total of 20, after which you resume earning downtime normally.

        The Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon is a loose-knit league of

        and sundry formidable scalawags of all races and vocations” (according
        to its charter). It represents adventurers’ interests in town and helps
        regulate the profitable exploration of the surrounding ruins.
  
        To initially join the Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon, a character must
        speak to Jotan Silverhammer, lieutenant guildmaster and volunteer sergeant
        of the Town Watch. There is no cost if you discovered the cause of the
        illness affecting the Old City, or if you obtain one of the **Local Pursuit**
        story awards, due to your substantial contribution to prosperity of the
        Old City. Otherwise, initial dues are 50 gp, with additional payments of
        12 gp a month. These costs are waived, however, for volunteers either who
        work three shifts a month for the Town Watch. In game terms, this means a
        character must spend 50 gp to join, and to remain a member, whenever they
        spend downtime, they must spend an additional 4 gp for every 10 downtime
        days they spend (though you may be able to substitute downtime for this
        cost, see below).
  
        If a character who owes these dues fails to pay them as soon as they spend
        downtime, they must pay them by the end of their next game session or they
        lose all benefits of guild membership, and must pay the 50 gp initial dues
        again to regain them.
  
        Members of the Adventurers Guild may delve local ruins in search of treasure.
        They gain access to the **Guild Delving** downtime activity before or after
        any adventure set in Ylraphon.

    Civil disorder threatens to throw the leaderless town of Ylraphon into
    chaos. You find respite from this political strife when the Chiang Emporium
    hires you for an escort mission. The task: sail south to accompany a Chiang
    Emporium envoy on a return voyage to Ylraphon, where her wedding is to take
    place upon her arrival. The voyage is perilous, but not nearly as
    complicated as what awaits when you finally make it back to town. Part Three
    of the *Whispers Over Ylraphon* series.

    - name: Boon of the Sea Hags
      description: |-
        You bargained with sea hags, trading lives or goods for the benefit of
        those wicked creatures. They promised you a boon of luck, and the hags
        deliver on that promise: you have received a boon of bad luck.
  
        The next time you receive a point of Inspiration, it works in reverse,
        forcing you to roll with Disadvantage when you spend that point of
        Inspiration. As per the usual rule, you cannot have more than one point
        of Inspiration at a time, so you must spend any Inspiration you receive
        before you can get another one.
  
        Once this happens three times, this boon loses its effect, but the story
        award remains.

        Whether willful or not, your actions have somehow subverted the Chiang
        Emporium. Word of your deeds travels fast between the Chiang’s numerous
        mercantile posts. From there, your ill reputation spreads among Shou
        communities throughout the Sword Coast and beyond.
  
        You gain disadvantage on Charisma-based ability checks that involve
        interacting with individuals from House Chiang. Additionally, you gain
        disadvantage on those same checks that involve Shou individuals who
        are friendly or neutral towards House Chiang and the reigning Shou empire.
  
        You lose this story award and any of its effects if you ever earn
        the **Chiang Goodwill** story award.

        | 90–99                 | An exciting delve into a lost dwarven tomb. You recuperate half your lifestyle expenses and gain 1d6 x 10 gp. |
        | 100–109               | An unexpected discovery of a long-lost merchant house compound. You recuperate all your lifestyle expenses and gain 1d8 x 10 gp, as well as a book on the history of a Sword Coast city or town. (Have your DM select a title for it.) |
        | 110–119               | A lost shrine. You recuperate all your lifestyle expenses and gain 1d10 x 10 gp as well as a holy symbol for a deity of your choice. |
        | 120 or Higher         | Altar of the Ghost Hound. You find a millennia-old shrine to a god you cannot identify, with treasures laid upon an altar deep beneath the ground. You recuperate all your lifestyle expenses and gain 1d12 x 10 gp as well as a *potion of healing*. ***If this is the first time you have rolled this result:*** You also gain a shining copper cloak-pin bearing the image of a flaming spirit hound. Write down “Copper Pin of the Spirit Hound” as a separate story award on your logsheet. |

    - name: Ylraphon Adventurers Guild
      description: |-
        The Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon is a loose-knit league of
        “dungeoneers, tomb-robbers, errant crusaders, swashbuckling mercenaries,
        and sundry formidable scalawags of all races and vocations” (according
        to its charter). It represents adventurers’ interests in town and helps
        regulate the profitable exploration of the surrounding ruins.
  
        To initially join the Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon, a character must
        speak to Jotan Silverhammer, lieutenant guildmaster and volunteer
        sergeant of the Town Watch. There is no cost if you discovered the
        cause of the illness affecting the Old City, or if you obtain one of
        the **Local Pursuit** story awards, due to your substantial contribution
        to prosperity of the Old City. Otherwise, initial dues are 50 gp, with
        additional payments of 12 gp a month. These costs are waived, however,
        for volunteers either who work three shifts a month for the Town Watch.
        In game terms, this means a character must spend 50 gp to join, and to
        remain a member, whenever they spend downtime, they must spend an
        additional 4 gp for every 10 downtime days they spend (though you may
        be able to substitute downtime for this cost, see below).
  
        If a character who owes these dues fails to pay them as soon as they
        spend downtime, they must pay them by the end of their next game
        session or they lose all benefits of guild membership, and must pay
        the 50 gp initial dues again to regain them.
  
        Members of the Adventurers Guild may delve local ruins in search of
        treasure. They gain access to the **Guild Delving** downtime activity
        before or after any adventure set in Ylraphon.

    The many disasters plaguing the first-ever Ylraphon Convocation of Delvers,
