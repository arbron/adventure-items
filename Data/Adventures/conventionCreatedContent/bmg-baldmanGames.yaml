    - name: Knight of the Plume
      description: |-
        For bravery in the face of overwhelming odds, you have been awarded the
        title of “Knight of the Plume, Protector of Hillsfar.” This new-found
        order has established by First Lord Vuhm Yestral of Hillsfar, and you
        are the first group to have been awarded this honor. While within the
        jurisdiction of Hillsfar, you can expect to be addressed with the
        honorific “Sir” or “Lady” depending on your preference. The doors of
        Hillsfar Castle are open to you, and you can get lodging and a meal
        there.

        In addition, you have been titled with a small plot of barren land on
        the outskirts of Hillsfar, outside the city walls. The land is currently
        in bad shape, as the armies of the dark fey have ravaged it while
        approaching Hillsfar. The deed and title to this land can be held for
        as long as the character is alive, but it cannot be transferred to
        anyone else. In addition, because of the current political unrest in
        Hillsfar, no development can take place on this land until this character
        earns another story award which allows for development of the land.

        In return for the title and the land, you are expected to act in a manner
        befitting the title, especially when you are representing Hillsfar to
        people outside of Hillsfar and the Moonsea region. Reports of questionable
        behavior getting back to the leaders of Hillsfar could result in having
        this honor rescinded.

    - name: Chunk of Adamantine
      description: |-
        For rescuing dwarven master-smith Boltac Thurdingard from the assassin,
        he gave you this chunk of raw adamantine ore. You can sell this chunk
        for 50 gp, or you can use the ore to craft a new weapon (it cannot be
        retroactively applied to an existing item). If you have multiple copies
        of this certificate, then you may combine them to forge a larger item.

        Only the items listed on this certificate may be forged using this
        certificate. Each item costs the listed number of chunks (each copy of
        this certificate represents one chunk and all certificates used must be
        voided at the same time; note the transaction on your logsheet).

        - 1 chunk – dagger, light hammer, sickle
        - 2 chunks – handaxe, javelin, mace, spear, scimitar, shortsword, trident
        - 3 chunks – battleaxe, flail, longsword, morningstar, rapier, war pick, warhammer
        - 4 chunks – glaive, greataxe, greatsword, halberd, lance, maul, pike

        An adamantine weapon has the same game statistics as a normal (non-magical)
        weapon of its type, but its attacks can bypass the damage resistance of
        certain types of creatures.

        In addition to voiding the certificates needed to create the item, you
        must also pay the item’s normal market price as listed in the *Player’s
        Handbook*. Record the transaction on your logsheet. The item you forge
        does not have its own certificate and therefore is not tradable.

        You gave up your soul to the arcanoloth known as the Binder. If you die,
        no magic can return your soul to your body. The lack of a soul has
        changed you though. Everything you eat tastes bland. Colors are less
        vibrant. Jokes are less funny, unless someone gets hurt. If you are ever
        brought back to life, you hear a voice in the darkness say, “I’ll let
        you live… this time!.”

    - name: Capt. Bluto’s Blunderbuss
      description: |-
        This smoke powder musket was owned by the feared giff pirate, Capt.
        Boris Blutovich. Possessing this item has both advantages and
        disadvantages in the Moonshaes.
  
        The item is first and foremost a deadly weapon. It is a martial
        ranged weapon that does 1d12 piercing damage, weighs 10 lbs., has
        a range of 40/120, and has the loading, two-handed firearms, and
        ammunition properties.
  
        Because of the age of the powder, there is a 25% chance that a shot
        misfires. If a misfire occurs, the bullet doesn’t discharge and the
        powder flashes, blinding the shooter until the end of its next turn.
  
        There are three silvered shot bullets, and just enough smoke powder
        left for each one. These shots may only be used during a Moonshae Isle
        adventure. If the character plays an adventure outside of the Moonshae
        Isles, the powder goes bad and is no longer usable.
  
        This item comes from another world and works unlike any other. Ammo and
        powder cannot be crafted for it. Once the three shots are used, or the
        powder goes bad, it becomes a mundane object and may never be operated
        again. It cannot be duplicated magically. **This is NOT a magic item**.
  
        The blunderbuss is a recognized item in the Moonshae region. Even those
        who haven’t seen it, may recognize it based on local stories. At the DM’s
        discretion, it may evoke strong reactions of celebration, fear, or anger.

        their control of them is not growing at an equal speed. It did however
