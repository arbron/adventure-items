        This act of kindness has forever changed you. You gain a new Flaw based
        on the virtue you donated:

        - **Humility**: You lost all modesty. Your pride is the most important
        thing and you will not suffer insult.
        - **Kindness**: Kindness is a tool of the weak and you are not weak. You
        lose the ability to feel sympathy or compassion for anything or anyone.
        - **Temperance**: Food, wine, drink, gambling, and many other substances
        are your birthright. You lost all restraint: indulgence is your middle
        name.
        - **Chastity**: Pleasures of the flesh are the reason the gods have
        placed you on Toril. Who are you to deny anyone the gift the gods send
        them?
        - **Patience**: You deserve to get what you want when you want it.
        Delays, no matter how small, send you into a rage.
        - **Charity**: You work hard for all you have, why should you share with
        others? You are the personification of selfishness. Everything you have
        is yours, and you plan to keep it.
        - **Diligence**: If you wanted to work hard you’d be a farmer not an
        adventurer. You always take short cuts and seek the quickest path to
        your goals perferring others to do the work for you.
