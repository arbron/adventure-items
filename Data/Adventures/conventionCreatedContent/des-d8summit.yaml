    Jeny Greenteeth gives you a letter that must reach its far-off destination,
    with frightening consequences if it doesn’t make it there by nightfall. Jeny
    knows one way to accomplish this, but her method of travel isn’t for the
    weak of spirit. All magic has a price, dearies, and these magics may have
    you doubting your sanity.
