  description: >-
    Orc raids are commonplace in Faerun and the village of Mantera had learned
    to deal with that reality. However, that reality changed 2 nights ago when
    mysterious lights over an Orc encampment near the village heralded a new
    wave of undead and diseased orcish berserkers lead by strange priests. The
    village has been battered and many of its citizens are poisoned by their
    attacks. So a local priestess sent out a call for Adventurers to come to
    their aid.

        The frozen, inhospitable wilderness of Stygia is home to many vile
        creatures as well as an uncountable number from the Material Plane.
        Desperate criminals and those condemned to death may pray to Levistus,
        the ruler of Stygia, for freedom; should he answer, they are transported
        here. For reasons known only to you and him, you are forever banned from
        setting foot within Stygia. Perhaps you redeemed too many souls, or
        maybe you were discovered to be in league with Geryon, the former ruler
        of this realm; regardless, Levistus has closed this layer of the Nine
        Hells to you. You can’t participate in further adventures in this place.

        A character with this story award may visit other areas of the Nine Hells
        but has been banned from Stygia.
