    Perpetual twilight awaits heroes when a simple request leads them to lands
    beyond time, beyond mortal understanding, and where those with twisted fates
    pray for atonement and freedom. Will joyful light return to this ancient
    land or will the curiosity of an outsider bring ruin to all. Part Two of the
    *Tales of Estirwald*.

      description: >-
        You have found a spectral six-legged kitten with small bumps on its
        shoulders. The kitten keeps blinking in and out of view, suggesting that
        it may have once been a Displacer Beast kitten. If you decide to keep
        it, you find it extremely playful and friendly. After several adventures
        you realize it will never grow into an adult.

      description: >-
        You attempted to break into The Magician Randel Malark Ambledragon’s
        house instead of politely knocking at the door and he was not amused. To
        make sure that the world will know of your unlawful ways he has
        permanently changed the colour of your hands and forearms to a
        fluorescent purple colour that sparkles when in light of any source.

        Your generosity and good nature were on display by agreeing to play
        Jim’s game, despite hearing the ridiculous rules. As you leave the
        clearing where The Magician Randel Malark Ambledragon’s house is you
        feel something squirming in your pocket. A tiny Zorbo pops its head out
        and looks at you. This tiny zorbo is utterly harmless as fits in the
        palm of your hand. This creature has no mechanical effects and is a pet
        only, albeit a mischievous pet that loves playing games.

  name: For The Greater Good
  description: >-
    There are the best of times; there are the worst of times; and then there are the
    current times. War, famine and disease run rampant across the realms. Rumour has
    it that whole cities have been swallowed into the depths of hell. Thay is expanding
    its borders. Yet in the area around Estirwald all is calm and bountiful. Many just
    consider themselves lucky, that is, until an urgent call from Ambledragon is sent
    out. What could be so urgent to someone as old and powerful as he is?
