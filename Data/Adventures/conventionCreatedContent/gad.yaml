  storyAwards:
    - name: High Blade in Your Debt
      description: |-
        You prevented an alliance between an efreeti pasha and the Cult of
        Reborn Flame, you rescued Selfaril Uoumdolphin from a mental prison
        woven by a hag coven, and you prevented the people and city of Mulmaster
        from being engulfed in lava by the Black Phoenix. For these deeds and
        more, the High Blade of Mulmaster is in your debt. With his city overrun
        by Thayans, Selfaril cannot repay that debt now, but perhaps that may
        change one day.
