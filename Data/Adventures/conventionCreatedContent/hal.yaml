      description: >-
        Sometimes at night, when a star falls across an outdoor sky on a
        moonless night, or when a lantern’s faint light can be seen through a
        foggy city morning, you remember the soft light of the nightworms. Yet,
        there is a worry there. Did you truly find the cause of their demise or
        will they perish to their unknown predator and be forever gone from
        anything but dreams? Your sleep after such thoughts is uneasy.
