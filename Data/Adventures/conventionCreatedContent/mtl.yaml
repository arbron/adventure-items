    New allies in the Underdark have emerged and are key to stopping drow
    slave-taking raids around the Moonsea. Now, one such ally has been
    assassinated and her body has been left to the most unpredictable and vile
    of Zethlentyn’s drow. What depraved price will the worshippers of the
    dreaded death goddess Kiaransalee set for their assistance? Are the
    adventurers ready to pay it? Part Two of the *Spies Below the Moonsea* series.

        The dark experiences in this adventure may take a psychological toll on
        certain characters. This toll is not represented by any mechanical
        effect and is entirely optional. Players are not required to take note
        of this if they do not wish to.
  
        Any character that participated in the minor graverending ritual and allowed
        the revenant to proceed on its dark business OR participated in the TRIAL OF
        DEATH and left Erkulia in the hands of the Yathrinshee may choose to add the
        following to the list of their bonds:

        If the character is of a non-evil alignment:

        - I once participated in an evil act that resulted in the death of a
        stranger and seek atonement for this act.

        If the character is of an evil alignment:

        - Partaking in an evil act has made me more conscious of the
        consequences of my actions.

        This bond carries no mechanical effect and can be removed by the player at
        any time.

  description: >-
    Are you ready to turn the tables and enact a devious ambush against drow
    slavers? Do you want to visit a tavern run by an illithid? Have a run in
    with a dwarf battlerager? This is your chance! The simmering conflict
    between the freedom fighters of House Tor’Erhyl and the Lolth-serving
    slavers of House Ouss’Nassath has reached its boiling point. Following the
    recent assassination of a sword dancer, Matron Tor’Erhyl makes a bold plan
    to strike back where it hurts most—the slave shipments. Yet this not merely
    a mission of vengeance—it’s one of mercy and liberation. Part Three of the
    *Spies Below the Moonsea* series.
