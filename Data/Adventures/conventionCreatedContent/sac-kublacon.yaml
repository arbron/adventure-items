  description: >-
    Your party has been tasked with guarding a supply caravan headed over the
    Dragonspire Mountains to the Citadel of the Raven. While there must have
    been some concern great enough to warrant sending adventurers of your
    caliber, the journey has been uneventful and borderline boring. When nearing
    the end of your journey, you stumble upon the most sacred of Faerûn's
    beasts…a dog! She seems lost and needs your assistance—a task fit for the
    good adventurers that you are.
