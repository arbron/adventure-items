  name: The Ember King
  description: >-
    The Tavern of the Ember King appears during the Feast of the Moon in an
    alleyway in Waterdeep. The tavern is the hospitable domain of the pixies
    who spark embers in campfires. New adventurers can go here to begin
    their journey in the Feywild, and veteran adventurers meet inside for
    drinks and stories. Coin isn’t needed here – food and drink can be
    purchased for a tale. For new Feywild explorers, the benevolent Ember
    King offers advice and their first adventure in exchange for the tale of
    their exploits. Once agreed, the now pixie-sized party finds themselves
    at the top of the tavern and have one hour to find their way to the bottom.

  name: The Monster of Wonderia
  description: |-
    The adventure takes place in the new Feywild Domain of Delight, Wonderia,
    a magical land where childlike fey creatures called wonderfey live. In this
    adventure, the characters are summoned to Wonderia by wonderfey. The
    wonderfey ask the characters to serve as their guardians during their
    journey to the Forbidden Mountain where it is rumored the Monster of
    Wonderia lives.

    Unbeknownst to the characters and the wonderfey, the Archfey of Wonderia,
    Abuelita Yvelise, resides there. Abuelita Yvelise is a sweet kindly storm
    giant who reveals the true nature of the wonderfey to the characters. The
    characters join the wonderfey in a ritual that takes place in the Archfey’s
    bag of holding where they must defeat vile fey creatures seeking to scare off
    the wonderfey from entering a portal that sends them to merge with each
    character’s soul at birth (time has no bounds in Wonderia!). The adventure
    concludes with the characters making choices that can completely reshape their
    own lives, including changing their race, class, gender, and other aspects of
    their character.

  name: Crumbling Castles & Candy Clouds
  description: >-
    The legendary city of Castamella, held aloft by cotton candy clouds, has
    meandered peacefully across the skies of the Feywild for time immemorial.
    But when its spires suddenly begin to crumble and crash through the sky
    below, only the adventurers stand between this idyllic haven and certain
    destruction. As factions coalesce in a battle that reaches beyond the
    borders of the sky, you must delve into the saccharine underbelly of this
    Seelie society to discover the culprits and stop their deliciously evil plans.

  name: The Landscape of Estorian LeFae
  description: >-
    Canvas is a self-contained domain inside of a painting, protected by magic and
    housing secrets to be hidden in plain sight although in a place of art and
    creation, anything can become reality, and that in itself is dangerous as
    the ruler is a bit eclectic. This Domain of Pigment is located inside of a
    painting drawn of a large tree covered in moss, raised on the ground, and with
    water flowing out of the base forming a small waterfall. It is labeled "Season's
    Fleetings" by Estorian LeFae.

    The painting changes to reflect different seasons from an outside perspective
    as the domain ruler's position changes. Inside of the painting is a collection
    of stories and artwork unique to the fey. This domain is a self-contained
    archive although the archive may have been less preserved and more acquired in
    selfish desire.

  name: A Meal to Remember
  description: >-
    Dwindle is a domain of loss and loneliness: a vast desert realm where memory
    and mirage are one and the same. Born out of the desperate wish of a grieving
    djinni-king, the magic sands of Dwindle give life to the memories of those we
    have lost. Eidolons of long-dead companions roam the dunes as sandy apparitions, 
    soughing with the wind that slowly erodes them. They are called the Departed.

    Forough Khanom (foe-ROOGH KHAH-noom), an elderly resident of Dwindle, is
    preparing an elaborate feast for a much anticipated visitor—the memory of her
    beloved late husband, who visits her once each year around the time of their 
    anniversary. However, she awoke this morning to find her vegetable garden
    mysteriously trampled! Forough asks the characters to brave the dunes in
    search of ingredients from an oasis known as the Sabzi Knoll. She fears that
    if she offers her visitor a meager spread, he may never show.
