  description: |-
    Across the infinite layers of the Lower Planes, a band of heroes desperately
    hunts for the whereabouts of an ancient weapon—one that could very well
    turn the tide of the eternal Blood War.

    With the help of the archmage Mordenkainen, these adventurers must stop
    the great Leviathan from falling into fiendish hands. Can they unlock the
    mysteries of the war machine before it’s too late?

  name: Escape from Wheloon
  description: >-
    The walled city of Wheloon holds the criminal population of Cormyr. The
    residents of that place are bound to it forever and cut off from the outside
    world. Inside, plans are made and malcontents pool their resources–and
    outside, forces influence the innocent to ensure that a dire plot can be
    realized without interference from the knights and mages that guard the
    realm. Now you’re here with no memory of what brought you to Wheloon, and
    all you can think of is finding out why!
