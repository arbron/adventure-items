  description: |-
    **Dare to descend into the Underdark in this adventure for the worldâ€™s
    greatest roleplaying game!**
  
    The Underdark is a subterranean wonderland, a vast and twisted labyrinth
    where fear reigns. It is the home of horrific monsters that have never
    seen the light of day. It is here that the dark elf Gromph Baenre,
    Archmage of Menzoberranzan, casts a foul spell meant to ignite a magical
    energy that suffuses the Underdark and tears open portals to the demonic
    Abyss. What steps through surprises even him, and from that moment on,
    the insanity that pervades the Underdark escalates and threatens to
    shake the Forgotten Realms to its foundations. Stop the madness before
    it consumes you!
