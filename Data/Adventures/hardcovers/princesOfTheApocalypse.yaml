  description: |-
    **Abolish an ancient evil threatening devastation in this adventure for the
    world’s greatest roleplaying game!**
  
    Called by the Elder Elemental Eye to serve, four corrupt prophets have risen
    from the depths of anonymity to claim mighty weapons with direct links to
    the power of the elemental princes. Each of these prophets has assembled a
    cadre of cultists and creatures to serve them in the construction of four
    elemental temples of lethal design. It is up to adventurers from heroic
    factions such as the Emerald Enclave and the Order of the Gauntlet to
    discover where the true power of each prophet lay, and dismantle it before
    it comes boiling up to obliterate the Realms.
