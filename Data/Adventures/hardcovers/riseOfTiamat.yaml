  description: |-
    **Avert the Cataclysmic Return of Tiamat in this Adventure for the Worldâ€™s
    Greatest Roleplaying Game.**
  
    The Cult of the Dragon leads the charge in an unholy crusade to bring
    Tiamat back to the Realms, and the situation grows more perilous for good
    people with each passing moment. The battle becomes increasingly political
    as opportunities to gather allies and gain advantage present themselves.
    From Waterdeep to the Sea of Moving Ice to Thay, it is a race against Evil.
    Succeed or succumb to the oppression of draconic tyranny. Win or lose,
    things will never be the same again.
