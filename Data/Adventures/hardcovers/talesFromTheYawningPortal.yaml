  name: Tales from the Yawning Portal
  description: |-
    When the shadows grow long in Waterdeep and the fireplace in the taproom of
    the Yawning Portal dims to a deep crimson glow, adventurers from across the
    Forgotten Realms, and even from other worlds, spin tales and spread rumors
    of dark dungeons and lost treasures. Some of the yarns overheard by Durnan,
    the barkeep of the Yawning Portal, are inspired by places and events in
    far-flung lands from across the D&D multiverse, and these tales have been
    collected into a single volume.

    Within this tome are seven of the most compelling dungeons from the 40+ year
    history of Dungeons & Dragons. Some are classics that have hosted an untold
    number of adventurers, while others are some of the most popular adventures
    ever printed.
