    The Cult of the Dragon has come to Phlan, a lawless refuge on the Moonsea.
    Now, with no significant authority to stop the cult, other power groups in

    Alliance, and even the Zhentarim—must unite to stop the cult from fulfilling
    its dark purpose in the city. Join the fight by participating in any one of
    five different missions aimed at stopping the cult.

    - name: Traded with a Hag
      description: >-
        Either out of greed, naivety, or sheer ignorance, you traded with a hag
        and now bear a mark visible only to other fey. Any Charisma (Persuasion)
        checks made to positively influence non-evil fey are made with
        disadvantage. In order to remove this mark, the hag that you traded with
        must willingly return the "payment" you rendered in the trade.

    Radiance and ascend to greater prominence amongst his kind?
