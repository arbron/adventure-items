        This lidded brass container holds a tiny sand timer suspended behind glass. No
        matter how the container is orientated, the sand always falls from one side of
        the timer to the other, taking exactly 24 hours to deplete. Once depleted, the
        sand timer spins around to reset itself.
    - name: Wand of Whimsy
      rarity: common
      flavor: |-
        This wand has 8 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of
        its charges and create one of the following effects:

        - Change the hair color or hair style of a creature you can see within 50 feet
        - Cause a small cloud of butterflies to flutter from the tip of the wand
        - Conjure a brief, tinkling melody from the wand

        The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s
        last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand transforms into a cloud of butterflies,
        which flutter away.
