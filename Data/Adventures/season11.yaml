    - name: Fold-Up Friend
      rarity: common
      flavor: >-
        While this cut-out parchment character is within 5 feet of you, you can command
        it to walk, play, dance, or follow you. The fold-up friend cannot take actions
        and cannot manipulate objects. It has AC 12 and 1 hit point.
    - name: Giant Gloves
      rarity: common
      flavor: >-
        While wearing these oversized gloves, your hands magically expand to fill their
        volume. You gain no benefit from this.
    - name: Pocket Watch
      rarity: common
      flavor: >-
        This lidded brass container holds a tiny sand timer suspended behind glass. No
        matter how the container is orientated, the sand always falls from one side of
        the timer to the other, taking exactly 24 hours to deplete. Once depleted, the
        sand timer spins around to reset itself.
    - name: Wand of Whimsy
      rarity: common
      flavor: |-
        This wand has 8 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of
        its charges and create one of the following effects:

        - Change the hair color or hair style of a creature you can see within 50 feet
        - Cause a small cloud of butterflies to flutter from the tip of the wand
        - Conjure a brief, tinkling melody from the wand

        The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wandâ€™s
        last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand transforms into a cloud of butterflies,
        which flutter away.
    - name: Whoopee Cushion
      rarity: common
      flavor: >-
        When sat upon, this rubber pillow emits a funny noise. Any creature within 30
        feet must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or break out into fits of laughter.
