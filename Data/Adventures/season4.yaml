        Having befriended the strange raven Esselios, if you are capable of
        casting *find familiar* you may take the talkative raven in that role.
        In addition to the other benefits of having a familiar, Esselios offers
        the following:

        - His Intelligence is 4 (‐3) and he can speak Orc and Elvish in addition
        to Common.
        - He grants advantage on checks regarding Orc history, religion, and
        culture.
        - He sometimes gets moody and petulant, muttering to himself in a
        language no one understands—even through the use of *comprehend
        languages*.

        can be heard only as the softest of whispers. Occasionally shadowy forms
        can be seen moving through the mist, as if the victim were not alone.

        No amount of cleaning will remove it; even magical attempts to remove the

    - name: Nettle (Hand Crossbow, +2)
      rarity: rare
      properties:
        - Guardian
      flavor: |-
        This hand crossbow looks to have seen better times. The wood is cracked and
        splintered and the string is heavily-frayed. A large, blue feather hangs from
        the handgrip alongside a couple green, glass baubles. The crossbow whispers
        warnings to its bearer, granting a +2 bonus to initiative if the bearer isn't 
        incapacitated.

        ***Sentience.*** Nettle is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an
        Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and
        darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. Nettle speaks Common and Halfling.

        ***Personality.*** Nettle is greedy and impetuous, and prefers that its
        wielder share these ideals. It demands to be better taken care of than its
        previous owners did. If its bearer is lawfully-aligned, or if its bearer does
        not spend at least an hour each day tending to it (polishing, applying resin
        to the string, etc.), Nettle denies its bonuses to attack and damage rolls
        and initiative checks. It also shouts out insults to those nearby, imposing
        disadvantage on any Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) checks or Dexterity
        (Stealth) check that its wielder makes to move silently.
    - name: Skyfist (Dwarven Thrower)
      rarity: veryRare
      flavor: >-
        The striking surface of this hammer has been forged into the shape of a
        gauntleted fist. The haft is a rod of heavy, black adamantine and wrapped in
        what appears to be spongy, green leather. Affixed to an iron ring on the pommel
        is a strip of tattered (though indestructible) blood-stained parchment inscribed
        with a dwarven battle canticle. When used in battle the hammer reads the canticle
        aloud in a deep, resonating voice audible to anyone within 30 feet of the weapon.
    - name: Staff of Healing
      rarity: rare
      flavor: >-
        The smooth wood of this ordinary-looking staff is pale, and streaked with
        multi-colored veins. The staff is capped with a hollow, glass sphere that
        creates an illusory holy symbol of whichever deity the wielder worships.
        Luminescent butterflies flit around the staff's cap and while in possession
        of the staff, the wilder feels fortunate and optimistic about what the
        future holds.
    - name: Staff of Power
      rarity: veryRare
      properties:
        - Language
      flavor: >-
        This staff is carved from a single piece of an unusual, purple wood and topped
        with a clenched, mithral claw. The claw clutches a green dragon scale the size
        of a small plate engraved with the elven word for *“Oblivion”*. The rune glows
        with a pale, green light and emits wisps of choking, caustic mist. Whoever is
        attuned the staff is able to speak, read, and write Draconic.
    - name: Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone)
      rarity: uncommon
      flavor: >-
        The center of this fist-sized emerald appears to be hollow and filled with a
