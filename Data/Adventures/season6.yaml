        Made of tattered, patched canvas and stitched together with thick, coarse

        component of the beastly thing is the saucer-sized black dragon scale that
        hangs over the wearer’s chest when the cloak is worn. It is glossy and bears
        the sigil of Nightscale herself.

        You faced the drow goddess Kiaransalee until the bitter end. However,
        she won—you were utterly destroyed and your soul was consumed. If you

        You cannot be resurrected or otherwise returned to life until another
        character spends 100 downtime days searching the planes of existence for
        you and also spends 200,000 gp in bribes and resources with greater
        demons and elder powers. This bargaining is exhausting for all parties
        involved, but if you are returned to life you do so with a deeper

        liches have more power in their fingers than most mortals will ever
        know, and this is no exception: you can use this appendage while casting
        a spell in order to impose disadvantage on the spell target’s saving

        cannot be reconstructed by any means, including *wish*.

      description: >-
        You managed to convince the drow mercenary company Bregan D’Arthe to
        turn their back on the conflict. This cost no small amount of gold, and
        word of your actions will spread. While the mercenaries themselves are
        discreet about their funding, there were other ears and eyes in the
        Underdark that day. What this means for you will remain to be seen.
