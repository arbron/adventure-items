      description: >-
        Through your efforts to thwart Dendar the Night Serpent, you
        inadvertently freed the lich Rhaugilath from his bondage to the archlich
        Larloch. While you have made one friend, another no doubt calls you an
        enemy.
    - name: Your Tale is Over
      description: >-
        In your last moments, you witnessed Dendar the Night Serpent consume the
        sun and crush the world in her coils. Even if there was some way to come
        back from that horrific death, there is no world to come back to. Your
        character is permanently retired.

  description: >-
    Pirates! Dastardly ne’er‐do‐wells have been spotted just outside of the
    harbor! Not content with scratching a living off of the rich port city’s
    scraps, pirates are making for the city by land and sea. But Port Nyanzaru
    is far from defenseless; pick up a yklwah, climb aboard a dinosaur, or man
    the wall; but whatever you do, don’t let those rapscallions into the city!

    - name: Alliance Black Operative
      description: |-
        You’ve proven to your superiors in the Lords’ Alliance that you can get
        things done: even if it means breaking the law. Now the nobility turn to
        you under cover of night with dark deeds in mind.

        Between adventures, you can spend ten downtime days to carry out a covert
        Lords’ Alliance contract and gain one renown with your faction. You may
        only perform this activity once between each adventure you play.
    - name: Barnacles the Parrot
      description: |-
        You own a trained **parrot** called “Barnacles”. Barnacles knows many
        saucy nautical phrases and has the uncanny ability to detect lies.

        You can use Barnacles’ Wisdom (Insight) modifier of +4 in addition to
        your own when attempting to detect lies. If Barnacles smells a rat, he’ll
        squawk one of the following phrases: “Thar she blows!”, “Hang ‘em from
        the yardarm!”, or “Blow the man down!”.

    - name: Eye-Patch
      description: |-
        You lost an eye while trying to steal from Port Nyanzaru’s merchants,
        and now wear a leather patch over your gaping eye socket. If you lift
        the patch, you can double your proficiency modifier in the Intimidation
        skill.

        You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight
        and on ranged attack rolls. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can
        restore the lost eye and remove this story award.
    - name: Flying Snake
      description: |-
        You’ve unmasked the merchant prince Ifan Talro’a as a criminal. For now,
        the Emerald Enclave is sitting on the information, choosing to monitor
        the prince rather than show their hand. As reward, they’ve given you a
        trained **flying snake** to serve as your messenger.

        Once per adventure, you can attach a message to the flying snake and send
        it to one of your allies. This functions as an *animal messenger* spell,
        but the message can only be sent to people you know.
      type: pet
    - name: Hero of Port Nyanzaru
      description: |-
        You helped the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru defeat Captain Smoke’s
        pirate armada, and you’re now known as a hero throughout the city.

        You gain advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with the merchant
        princes. If you start a session within Port Nyanzaru, you gain advantage
        on the first attack roll or saving throw that you make.
    - name: Hook for a Hand
      description: |-
        A pirate chopped off your hand, and you replaced it with a rusty hook.
        Your unarmed attacks now deal 1d6 piercing damage.

        While you wear the hook, you can hold only a single object at a time.
        You have disadvantage on attacks made with weapons that use two hands.
        Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost appendage
        and remove this story award.
    - name: Map of the Jungle
      description: |-
        You rescued Gordo the Just from the clutches of Captain Walharrow. In
        return, he gifted you a fragment of a rare map of the jungle.

        The *Tomb of Annihilation* hardcover adventure provides an unfinished
        map of Chult. At any time, you can strike through this story award to
        reveal map details in a 2‐hex diameter from any point on the map you
        choose. Alternatively, you can strike through this story award to
        succeed on any check made to navigate through jungle terrain.
    - name: Peg Leg
      description: |-
        You lost your foot in a tomb beneath Port Nyanzaru, and wear a wooden
        peg leg in its place. Your peg leg has a hidden compartment that’s ideal
        for concealing a coin purse or a set of thieves’ tools.

        While you wear the peg leg, your speed on foot is halved and you have
        disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Magic such as the
        *regenerate* spell can restore the lost appendage and remove this
        story award.
    - name: Pirate’s Curse
      description: |-
        You failed to protect Port Nyanzaru from Captain Smoke’s pirate armada.
        As a parting shot, the pirates cursed you from beyond the grave.

        You gain disadvantage on the first attack roll or saving throw you make
        during a session. Only a *remove curse* spell or similar magic can dispel
        the curse and remove this story award.
    - name: Uku the Spider Boy
      description: |-
        A naughty **flying monkey** called “Uku the Spider Boy” has latched onto
        you. Uku (“OO‐koo”) wears a crimson waistcoat adorned with tiny mirrors
        and sports a silk skullcap. He has a naturally mischievous nature.

        Uku can smell gold from 30 feet away, even if it’s kept inside a purse
        or container. As an action, you can command Uku to steal or retrieve up
        to 100gp using his Sleight of Hand skill bonus of +4. Uku keeps 10% of
        the takings, which he spends on boiled sweets next time you’re in town.

      description: >-
        Your understanding of the maze of life has pleased the great god Ubtao.
        To save his people, the god has granted you the ability to foresee your
        own failures and react accordingly. **Once before the end of this
        event**, you can undo any action you take after it has been resolved.
        This could be an action taken during combat, or a character action you
        describe to the DM outside of combat. Time literally resets to the
        moment before the action was taken, yet you remain cognizant of its
        outcome.

        You promised the soul of a loved one to the dark champion Dagkamir, and
        he disappeared mysteriously to claim his due. You’ll never know when
        he’ll strike, or if you can ever undo your promise. It will haunt you
        forever. Whenever you use inspiration, you must use any “1” you roll on

        forevermore. You have advantage on saving throws made to resist spells
        cast by necromancers and other undead creatures.

        to resist disease.
