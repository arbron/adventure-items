  storyAwards:
    - name: Faction Favor
      description: |-
        You have won the favor of two of the great factions: The Emerald
        Enclave, the Lords’ Alliance, the Zhentarim, the Order of the Gauntlet,
        the Harpers, or Force Grey (circle which factions apply when you receive
        this award). As the bearer of this award, you may at any time replace
        your own background feature with the **Safe Haven** background feature
        (*Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide*).

        In addition, you may call upon these factions to cast raise dead on your
        character if your remains are taken to Waterdeep. Doing so removes this
        story award from your record. You can use this favor even if you don’t
        have the Faction Agent background.
    - name: Marmaduke the Tomcat
      description: |-
        This old ginger tomcat has a heart of gold and likes nothing better than
        to snooze on your lap. He wears a name tag on his collar that identifies
        him as “Marmaduke”, but the tag has chipped off just underneath “This
        Cat Belongs To…”. If you can find Marmaduke’s owner, you’re sure to get
        a reward!

        Unfortunately, Marmaduke is extremely cowardly. During combat, he leaps
        onto you and digs his claws in, never letting go and scrambling all over
        your body. Treat this as a flaw—if you use it to your disadvantage, your
        DM can grant inspiration at their discretion.

    - name: Endless Bluetooth Ale
      description: |-
        If a way was discovered to set up a supply of the blue lichen to the
        Yawning Portal, Durnan provides all the Bluetooth Ale the characters can
        drink whenever they visit. Brewed from the blue lichen grown on the
        skeletons of dwarves left for dead in the Stonebone Mines, bluetooth ale
        is a truly unique beverage.

        The strong dwarven-style ale is a rich sapphire color and has a faint
        earthy taste. While the ale lacks most of the special properties of the
        blue lichen, it still can turn the imbibers teeth (and bones) temporarily
        blue.

        The ale functions as an ingested poison. The drinker must succeed on a DC
        12 Constitution saving throw, or their skeleton turns a dark shade of blue
        for 24 hours.
