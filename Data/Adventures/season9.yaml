        Galabraga is ancient even by hag standards, she has made countless
        bargains with all manner of creatures to her benefit. One does not live
        as long as she without having the occasional double cross or deal gone
        wrong, but woe to those that try.

        Galabraga is extremely irritated by having to have a new *simulacrum*
        made. She was visiting her numerous daughters residing in Minauros when
        the character destroyed her *simulacrum*. As such, she requests her
        daughters haunt the characters’ dreams until such time as they die.
        Galabraga allows her daughters to keep the souls for their service, see
        **Nightmare Haunting**. Characters who have assisted in destroying her
        *simulacrum* in any way earn this story award. If the characters provide
        Galabraga a new *simulacrum* and 5 *soul coins* for their insolence as
        well as her pain and suffering, may remove the story award.

    - name: Helm of Telepathy
      rarity: uncommon
      flavor: >-
        This cruel helm has been crafted to look like the screaming face of a devil.
        It’s always warm to the touch, and when you wear it you hear devilish
        whisperings that you can never quite discern.

        This sleeveless shawl is made from the stitched skin of many demons and devils.
    - name: Necklace of Adaptation
      rarity: uncommon
      flavor: >-
        The pendant of this necklace is an ovoid puzzle box of jagged black metal
        that screeches as it is operated. To activate the item, the puzzle box must
        be manipulated into a new configuration.

      description: |-
        A portion of your soul has been minted into a soul coin: part of the
        damnable currency of the Nine Hells. As the coin moves through the
        markets of the inferno, you feel an echo that affects your mind. At
        the start of every gaming session you participate in, roll a d6 to
        determine an effect for that game.

        | Rolled d6 | Effect    |
        |------     |------     |
        | 1–3       | No effect |
        | 4         | Your soul coin is spent wisely by its owner. You gain inspiration at the start of this session. |
        | 5         | Your soul coin is spent foolishly by its owner. You can’t earn inspiration during this session. |
        | 6         | Your soul coin is stolen from its owner. You can only spend inspiration to benefit other players during this session. |

      description: >-
        Your soul has been promised to a devil of the Nine Hells. If you die, it
        claims your soul and subjects it to an eternity of torment. The only way
        you can be restored to life is via a wish or true resurrection spell,
        after which you can remove this award.

    Visitors from far and wide gather at Torm’s Hand to honor a fallen hero.
    Yet, the somber day turns to chaos when a hell-spawned maw erupts over the
    area, bringing an army of devils with it. Only true courage and sharp minds
    can banish the dark forces that seek to claim the souls of all within the
    holy temple. Are you ready to lead the charge?

    - name: Hellrider’s Badge - Klysandral’s Champion
      rarity: rare
      flavor: |-
        *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by someone designated by Duke
        Ulder Ravengard)*

        A Hellrider’s Badge is only usable by a member of the Hellriders, and thanks
        to your efforts during Klysandral’s funeral and the subsequent escape from
        Avernus you have been awarded honorary membership by Duke Ulder Ravengard
        himself. This badge marks you as a lieutenant in the Hellriders.

        While wearing the badge, you gain a +2 bonus to AC if you aren’t using a shield.
        If the badge is more than 5 feet away from you for more than one minute, it
        vanishes and harmlessly reappears on a surface within 5 feet of Duke Ravengard. 
        While holding the badge, the Duke know your location, provided the two of you
        are on the same plane of existence and your attunement to the badge hasn’t ended.

        As an action, the Duke can touch the badge and end your attunement to it, as he
        has been granted this power by Elturel despite not being a Hellrider himself.

        **Special**

        If you wish to take the Hellriders or Flaming Fist as your faction, you may do so. 
        Additionally, this badge is made from the bones of Klysandral himself, counts as a
        holy reliquary, and may be used as a holy symbol of Torm if needed.

    - name: Marked by Bel
      description: |-
        You agreed to make a deal with Bel or one of his minions. Your soul is
        now forfeit; if you die, you can only be restored to life via a *wish*
        or *true resurrection* spell, after which you can remove this award.
        Similarly, you regain hit dice at half the normal rate. However, Bel
        has granted you some special powers in exchange for this self-sacrifice:

        **Bel’s Blessings**

        | Cost       | Benefit   |
        |----------- |-----------|
        | 1 Hit Die  | Reroll a failed saving throw or an attack roll that missed its target. |
        | 2 Hit Dice | You grow leathery wings and a flight speed of 20 ft. for 1 minute. |
        | 3 Hit Dice | You may spend a bonus action to turn devils that are faithful to Zariel as if they were undead and you were using the Channel Divinity: Turn Undead cleric class feature. This has no effect on other creatures, or on devils that are devoted to an archdevil other than Zariel. You do not need to be a cleric to use this ability, nor do you need to wield a holy symbol—when you perform this profane rite, Bel’s sigil materializes above your head and glows with purple light. |
        | 5 Hit Dice | Bel delivers one common or uncommon permanent magic item to you. This item does not count against your magic item limit, and you may use this item for one hour at which time it crumbles to dust as it is reclaimed by the archdevil. |
        | 8 Hit Dice | Bel delivers one rare magic permanent magic item to you, or one uncommon consumable magic item. This item does not count against your magic item limit, and you may use this item for one hour at which time it crumbles to dust as it is reclaimed by the archdevil. |

  description: >-
    On this holy day (tribute to Leira and Mask), folk of all walks of life don
    masks and costumes to disguise themselves and play at being other than what
    they are. Festivities begin in the evening, when candles are placed in
    hollowed-out pumpkins carved with faces. Tricks and pranks of all kinds are
    common on this night, and pickpockets are rife on this day, so few carry
    much coin with them, having secreted it away somewhere the previous evening.
    Instead, people fill their pockets and belt pouches with candies. Come
    celebrate with us on the darkened streets of Baldur’s Gate.
