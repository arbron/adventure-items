  name: The Phantom Pursuit
  description: |-
    Caravan duty in the Cormanthor forest can be dangerous, but normally you only have
    to deal with bandits and the odd goblin. No-one said anything about the undead, but
    now you're being chased by a malevolent spirit!

    Can you escapeâ€”or will you die trying?

  name: Seclusion
  description: |-
    The sleepy and idyllic little villagers of Kuringrove know of a well-kept secret
    deep in the Cormanthor Forest. If you're lucky, you might stumble across the home
    of two elderly seers, who have lived here for longer than there's even been a village.

    They may be the only ones who can provide answers for all the strange goings on
    in the forest!
