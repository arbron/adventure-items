  description: >-
    A criminal band known as “Suldran’s Dark” who is active all over the Moonsea
    region and especially on the waters of the Moonsea itself, recently seized a
    caravel out of Phlan carrying trade-bars of smelted copper and “batons” of
    steel ready to be hammered into swords. Along with all of the cargo, the
    Dark seized six passengers for ransom. Little did they know that one of the
    passengers was a Harper agent. A rescue taking the party deep into the
    Cormanthor forest is now needed.

  name: The Heart of Shadow
  description: >-
    A great evil is rising in the Border Kingdoms. The dead walk the wilderness
    in greater numbers than ever before. As if they are driven to some hidden
    task or agenda. But they aren’t the only thing stirring in the wilds of the
    kingdoms. More shadows have woken in the dark places that the weak of will
    dare not go, but where the brave will dive into the heart of. Which are you?

  description: >-
    The ruins of Rith Keep lie a short distance from the small Border Kingdoms
    thorp of Largrin. In times past, the keep was home to the self-appointed
    River Lord of Largrin, a warrior of great skill who protected the
    surrounding lands. It is now little more than a stone shell, which rumors
    say is haunted. Are these tales simply the fanciful stories of local beet
    farmers, or does something more sinister lurk in the shadows of Rith Keep?
