    - name: I Got a Puppy!
      description: >-
        You chose to keep the wolf puppy that was trapped in the gnoll camp deep
        inside the Quivering Forest. It is incredibly friendly and knows a few
        tricks; sometimes it even brings you small presents like sticks, stones,
        or a dead animal. This silver-haired wolf pup never howls at the moon,
        but does love to play in the woods and wander through heavy fogs
        whenever possible. This is a non-combat pet and is intended for roleplay
        purposes only.
