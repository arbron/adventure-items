    **Unravel the mysteries of Ravenloft® in this dread adventure for the
    world’s greatest roleplaying game**

    Under raging storm clouds, the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich stands
    silhouetted against the ancient walls of Castle Ravenloft. Rumbling
    thunder pounds the castle spires. The wind’s howling increases as he
    turns his gaze down toward the village of Barovia. Far below, yet not
    beyond his keen eyesight, a party of adventurers has just entered his
    domain. Strahd’s face forms the barest hint of a smile as his dark plan
    unfolds. He knew they were coming, and he knows why they came; all
    according to his plan. A lightning flash rips through the darkness, but
    Strahd is gone. Only the howling of the wind fills the midnight air.
    The master of Castle Ravenloft is having guests for dinner—and you
    are invited.
