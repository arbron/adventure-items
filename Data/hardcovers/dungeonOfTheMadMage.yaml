  description: |-
    **Explore the mega-dungeon of Undermountain in this adventure for the
    world’s greatest roleplaying game.**
  
    In the city of Waterdeep rests a tavern called the Yawning Portal,
    named after the gaping pit in its common room. At the bottom of this
    crumbling shaft is a labyrinthine dungeon shunned by all but the most
    daring adventurers. Known as Undermountain, this dungeon is the domain
    of the mad wizard Halaster Blackcloak. Long has the Mad Mage dwelt in
    these forlorn depths, seeding his lair with monsters, traps, and
    mysteries—to what end is a constant source of speculation and concern.
    This adventure picks up where Waterdeep: Dragon Heist leaves off, taking
    characters of 5th level or higher all the way to 20th level should they
    explore the entirety of Halaster’s home. Twenty-three levels of
    Undermountain are detailed herein, along with the subterranean refuge of
    Skullport. Treasures and secrets abound, but tread with care!
