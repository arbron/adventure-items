  description: |-
    **Fight the war against draconic oppression in this adventure for the
    world’s greatest roleplaying game.**
  
    In an audacious bid for power, the Cult of the Dragon, along with its
    dragon allies and the Red Wizards of Thay, seek to bring Tiamat from
    her prison in the Nine Hells to Faerûn. To this end, they are sweeping
    from town to town, laying waste to all those who oppose them and
    gathering a hoard of riches for their dread queen. The threat of
    annihilation has become so dire that groups as disparate as the Harpers
    and Zhentarim are banding together in the fight against the cult. Never
    before has the need for heroes been so desperate.
