  description: >-
    Beneath the unyielding night sky, you stand before a towering glacier
    and recite an ancient rhyme, causing a crack to form in the great wall
    of ice. Beyond this yawning fissure, the Caves of Hunger await. What
    fantastic secrets and treasures are entombed in the sunless heart of
    the glacier, and what will their discovery mean for the denizens of
    Icewind Dale?
