  description: |-
    Giants have emerged from their strongholds to threaten civilization as never
    before. Hill giants are stealing all the grain and livestock they can while
    stone giants have been scouring settlements that have been around forever.
    Fire giants are press-ganging the smallfolk into the desert, while frost
    giant longships have been pillaging along the Sword Coast. Even the elusive
    cloud giants have been witnessed, their wondrous floating cities appearing
    above Waterdeep and Baldur’s Gate. Where is the storm giant King Hekaton,
    who is tasked with keeping order among the giants?

    The humans, dwarves, elves, and other small folk of the Sword Coast will be
    crushed underfoot from the onslaught of these giant foes. The only chance at
    survival is for the small folk to work together to investigate this invasion
    and harness the power of rune magic, the giants’ weapon against their
    ancient enemy the dragons. The only way the people of Faerûn can restore
    order is to use the giants’ own power against them.
