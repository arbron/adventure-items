  name: In Voloâ€™s Wake
  description: >-
    The town of Phandalin, nestled in the foothills to the east of the Sword
    Mountains, continues to grow since being rebuilt after the devastation
    wrought by rampaging orc hordes. It recently survived violent gang activity,
    drow machinations, and even the attention of a green dragon. But can it
    withstand a new threat, bizarre but no less perilous: the fame brought by a
    visit from none other than loremaster Volothamp Geddarm?
