  storyAwards:
    - name: Acererak's First Victim
      description: >-
        You were the first character at the D&D Open to die after the lich
        Acererak triggered the Soulmonger. This first exposure to the Soulmonger
        has a strange effect. If your character returns to life, the character
        has resistance to necrotic energy. The resistance fades away on June 1,
        2018.
    - name: Adventuring Makes Me Sleepy
      description: >-
        You were the first party to take a long rest in the 2017 D&D Open. Your
        caution and good sense were noted by the powers of this strange place,
        and you have been temporarily changed by that power. The next time you
        take a long rest after your current adventure, you receive a prophetic
        vision from the spirits of Chult. Ask a single question concerning a
        specific goal, event, or activity to occur in your current adventure.
        The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a
        cryptic rhyme, or an omen.
    - name: Alive in Death
      description: >-
        One of your companions slew a creature and dedicated it to Nanny Pu'Pu.
        In return, her enchanted green gem brought you back to life. Well…sort
        of. Your skin and features resemble those of a dead person. You gain the
        undead creature type, while still retaining your previous creature type.
        This condition remains for the rest of your character’s life. Undead
        monsters may ignore you until you attack them, but you have disadvantage
        of Charisma (Persuasion) checks with humanoid creatures.
    - name: Awesome Lunch Meat
      description: >-
        You distinguished yourself during the battle with the Giant
        Tyrannosaurus Rex of Doom! Ubtao is impressed by your cunning. Twice he
        grants you a boon, allowing you to reroll a failed check. Mark through
        this certificate when used the second time.
    - name: Big Game Hunter
      description: >-
        Your team struck the killing blow against the Giant Tyrannosaurus Rex of
        Doom! Tales of your prowess reach the merchant princes in Port Nyanzaru
        in Chult, who seek to curry your favor through favorable trade offers,
        including with other merchants. The next time you visit Fai Chen's
        market, you may purchase an item for half of the stated gold piece cost.
    - name: Blood for the Trickster Gods
      description: >-
        Your party was defeated at least five times by the dangers of Lake Luo's
        lost temples. Strangely, this pleased the Trickster Gods of Chult. They
        watch over you. The next time you are brought to 0 hit points, you are
        left with 1 hit point instead and you cannot be reduced below 0 hit
        points until the start of your next turn. Mark through this certificate
        once it has been spent.
    - name: The Chosen of Chult
      description: >-
        When you died in Chult, your soul left your body and was replaced by
        something ancient and mysterious. You now have the personality of an old
        and immortal being, but the rest of you is the same. For the rest of
        this adventure, you are resistant to all piercing, bludgeoning, and
        slashing damage.
  
         When the 2017 D&D Open concludes, you lose this resistance. However, some of that immortal soul remains with you. You have advantage on death saves.
    - name: Dice Tower Master
      description: >-
        You placed first in the Craft (dice tower) Challenge of Ubtao at the D&D
        Open! If you are reduced to 0 hit points, you may expend this
        certificate and build a tower out of six different polyhedral dice. As
        soon as you succeed, your character returns to consciousness with twice
        your level in hit points.
    - name: Explorer of Chult
      description: >-
        Your adventures in Chult, for good or woe, are spoken of by the
        residents of Port Nyanzaru. The bards of Chult sing of our exploits, and
        those songs may someday reach Baldur's Gate and beyond. Your fame in
        Port Nyanzaru makes you a local celebrity. You have advantage on
        Charisma (Perception) checks with residents and visitors to that port
        city.
    - name: Favor of Ubtao
      description: >-
        You have acted with honor, granting the relics of Ubtao to that lost
        god's worshippers. When you performed this act of kindness, you received
        a tattoo in the form of a labyrinth. When you touch the tattoo (no
        action), you (and only you) gain the benefit of a bless spell for 1
        minute. The power of the tattoo dissipates until you take a long rest.
        Once you reach 11th level, the power of the tattoo fades. Instead, you
        gain an extra hit point when you gain a level.
    - name: Glimpsed Into the Madness of Evil
      description: >-
        You have seen into the madness that is about to sweep through Chult.
        While you have seen an inkling of the doom that is coming, you also are
        imbued with energy to fight it. While adventuring in Chult, you gain 1
        additional hit point per spell level when you are cured by a spell that
        heals hit point damage. However, your dreams and visions are wracked
        with the terror that is coming. When you finish a long rest, you regain
        one less hit die than normal (to a minimum of 1).
    - name: Hated by the Evil Powers of Chult
      description: >-
        You have angered Acererak, and you are known to any of the creatures who
        serve him in Chult. These creatures favor attacking you in a battle.
        However, your success over their master has imbued you with a certain
        power. Whenever you take necrotic damage, you can use a reaction to gain
        resistance to necrotic damage until the start of your next turn. This
        power refreshes with a short rest.
    - name: I Like to Pace Myself
      description: >-
        You were the first party to take 2 short rests in the 2017 D&D Open.
        Your caution and good sense were noted by the powers of this strange
        place, and you have been temporarily changed by that power. The next two
        times you take a long rest after you leave Chult, you double the value
        of any hit dice you roll during the short rest.
    - name: I Need New Dice
      description: >-
        The next two times you roll a 1 on a d20 during an adventure after the
        D&D Open, you may reroll the d20, taking the second result. Mark through
        this certificate once it has been spent.
    - name: Infested With Evil Spirits
      description: >-
        The strange magic of Chult has returned you to life so many times during
        your adventures that you have been infested with evil spirits. Whenever
        you reach 0 hit points, one of the evil spirits takes control of you.
        When you are returned to consciousness, until you take a long rest, you
        gain the new flaw: “An unpredictable trickster spirit controls my
        actions.”
    - name: Master of Archery
      description: >-
        You placed first in the Archery Competition for the Challenge of Ubtao
        at the D&D Open! If your character is at disadvantage when making a
        ranged attack roll, you may expend this certificate to cancel the
        disadvantage.
    - name: Master of Intellect
      description: >-
        You placed first in the Intelligence (Mathematics) Challenge of Ubtao at
        the D&D Open! If you fail a skill check, you may expend this certificate
        and chose any one die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, or d20) and add the result
        to the roll. However, if the check fails, you may not use that die (or
        any die with that same number of sides) for the rest of the encounter.
    - name: Master of Senses
      description: >-
        You placed first in the Intelligence (Investigation) check for the
        Challenge of Ubtao at the D&D Open! If your character is blinded, you
        may close your eyes, roll a die, and guess whether the result is odd or
        even. If you are incorrect, you may not use this certificate this
        adventure. If you are correct, mark through this certificate. You are no
        longer blinded and cannot be blinded for the next 2 minutes.
    - name: Maze Runner
      description: >-
        You skillfully navigated Ubtao's maze, completing all of the encounter
        bonus conditions. Ubtao grants you a boon. When spending Hit Dice, you
        may expend this certificate to receive the maximum value of any dice
        rolled during a short rest. Mark through this certificate when used.
    - name: Nanny Pu'Pu's Charm
      description: >-
        This character activated Nanny Pu'Pu's rag doll charm during the
        adventure. Nanny Pu'Pu has claimed a bit of your soul. The first Wisdom
        saving throw you make after each long rest is made with disadvantage, as
        your sleep is wracked with the most horrible nightmares. Your screams
        and whimpering during sleep make it hard for others around you to rest.
        However, after a short rest, you gain 1 additional hit point for each
        Hit Die used.
    - name: Raider of the Lost Shrines
      description: >-
        You completed all of the bonus conditions for three or more Trickster
        God shrines! You have a knack for solving puzzles and noticing danger.
        The next time after this adventure that a trap targets you, any attacks
        against you automatically miss and you succeed at any skill checks or
        saving throws due to the trap going off. Mark through this certificate
        once it has been spent.
    - name: Still Standing
      description: >-
        Your party survived the second round of the D&D Open without any party
        member being brought to 0 hit points! Words of your prowess reach the
        Factions. You may expend this certificate to fulfil the secret mission
        requirements for Faction Advancement, so long as you meet the other
        requirements. You may instead expand this certificate to grant this
        benefit to another character, either your own or another player's
        character.
    - name: Ubtao's Chosen
      description: >-
        Your team was one of the first three to complete the cube puzzle,
        granting access to Ubtao's sunken temple! Ubtao watches you, and at two
        times of your choosing, grants you Inspiration. Mark through this
        certificate once expended.
    - name: A Worthy of Ubtao
      description: >-
        You were one of the fastest parties to complete Ubtao's challenge. For
        your wisdom and cunning, you start with inspiration in the next five
        adventures or story chapters you play.
