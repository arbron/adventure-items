        The corrupted lorenorn Quaryl Tellasarim had amassed a wealth of arcane

        collectors, but as they are first-hand accounts of direct interactions

        counter offer: a tenday of access to the great library’s vast resources
        in exchange for a full set of 6 tomes of a given school of magic.
        Alternately, you can turn in 3 sets of tomes in to Candlekeep in
        exchange for a 7th-level spell scroll of your choosing from an
        Adventurers League-approved source.

         If you attempt to surrender forgeries or duplicate copies to the acolytes at Candlekeep they will quickly discover your ruse. You will be ejected from Candlekeep until such time as you make a 10,000 gp donation or discover another campaign-approved method of removing this penalty.

        When you stay at a tavern in a large city (such as the Yawning Portal in
        Waterdeep), you may make a DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check; if
        successful your drinks and lodging are paid for by the other patrons. If
        unsuccessful, you are stuck with the bar tab for everyone that night.

         High-ranking elves may have a dim view of your unsanctioned activities in Myth Drannor. At your DM’s discretion, your Charisma-based skill checks are made with disadvantage when dealing with elf nobles and very strong spellcasters.

    Hatred burns with a fire unlikely any other; and the hotter the flame, the

    group of angry men and women seek to stoke smoldering embers of hate anew
    into a raging conflagration. Can you stop them before it is too late, or
    will evil rise once more from the ashes—free to burn all it touches?

        Pipyap prefers to enlist wayward devils into his crew, but a devil you
        know did him a solid, and he didn’t really have any other way of
        repaying them. As such, he’s infused you with a bit of his own Infernal
        nature. You gain proficiency in Infernal. In addition, if you’re hit by
        an attack, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to bludgeoning,
        piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren’t
        silvered until the end of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you
        can’t use it again until you’ve completed a long rest. This story award
        may only be applied to the character who gained the level awarded above.

         This boon isn’t without cost, however. Pipyap may come calling and refusing his call may have dire consequences, indeed.

        You have done a favor for the imp Pipyap and now he owes you one. You
        can cash in this favor in one of three ways:

        - Gain 150 gp.
        - Gain one consumable potion or scroll from Table A or B in the Dungeon
        Master’s Guide.
        - Pipyap arranges for your body to be recovered when otherwise thought
        lost. It’s best not to ask how he did it or where that strange smell
        came from.
         This favor goes both ways. Now that you have accepted something from the devil, he might call on you in the future to further your alliance.

    destruction near and far, but you were only doing what was demanded of you
    from those who hold you captive again now. A looming figure goes over your
    crimes and holds out a glowing gemstone, offering a trade for your lives.
    “You must undo what you have done and put this back,” he whispers. “You must
    return to the Ghost Tower.”

    Mulmaster moving ever closer to Thay’s orbit and strife brewing within the
    Factions for action, the hour is ripe for conflict.

      description: >-
        Your actions during the invasion of Mulmaster caught the attention of
        Szass Tam himself. As a result, he and his followers bear a special
        dislike for you. This will come up again in the future…
    - name: Planes in Pockets in Planes
      description: >-
        The Thayan mansion in Mulmaster was comprised of a series of nested
        demiplanes and pocket dimensions, and you survived the exploration—and
        brought back lingering traces of that magic. As a result, you always
        know what plane you are on, and if you find yourself away from your
        native plane you may excise this magic to return to the Prime Material
        plane immediately. If you do this, destroy this story award.
