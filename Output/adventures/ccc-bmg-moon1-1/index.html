<h2>Story Awards</h2>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Capt. Bluto’s Blunderbuss
</summary><p>This smoke powder musket was owned by the feared giff pirate, Capt. Boris Blutovich. Possessing this item has both advantages and disadvantages in the Moonshaes.</p><p>The item is first and foremost a deadly weapon. It is a martial ranged weapon that does 1d12 piercing damage, weighs 10 lbs., has a range of 40/120, and has the loading, two-handed firearms, and ammunition properties.</p><p>Because of the age of the powder, there is a 25% chance that a shot misfires. If a misfire occurs, the bullet doesn’t discharge and the powder flashes, blinding the shooter until the end of its next turn.</p><p>There are three silvered shot bullets, and just enough smoke powder left for each one. These shots may only be used during a Moonshae Isle adventure. If the character plays an adventure outside of the Moonshae Isles, the powder goes bad and is no longer usable.</p><p>This item comes from another world and works unlike any other. Ammo and powder cannot be crafted for it. Once the three shots are used, or the powder goes bad, it becomes a mundane object and may never be operated again. It cannot be duplicated magically. <strong>This is NOT a magic item</strong>.</p><p>The blunderbuss is a recognized item in the Moonshae region. Even those who haven’t seen it, may recognize it based on local stories. At the DM’s discretion, it may evoke strong reactions of celebration, fear, or anger. Pirates of Silver’s Blade react with deadly intent.</p>

<details class="story-award">
  <summary>A Dark Gem
</summary><p>You have recovered a mysterious gem named <em>Goblinwrath</em> for the Great Druid Antola Pilark. This gem carried with it an enchantment that caused goblins to become ferocious and feral while being biddable by the bearer. The origins of the gem are unknown, but Antola intends to find out and may call upon you to help her.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>A Debt Owed in Silver
</summary><p>You have killed Capt. Bluto and now the pirates of Silver’s Blade seek you out for revenge. Through a variety of underworld contacts and possibly divinations, they have identified as the killer. They won’t rest until you’re as dead as Capt. Bluto, but there may be ways to buy them off in the future.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Friend of the Rustfire Clan
</summary><p>You have assisted Winnow Rustfire on her mission to attain a red pearl. She now considers you a trusted friend. This story award may come into play in future Moonshae adventures from Baldman Games, particularly <strong>CCC-BMG MOON3-1</strong>, <strong>3-2</strong>, and <strong>3-3</strong>.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Happi the Unhappy Oyster
</summary><p>You have found a sentient talking oyster named Happi. He was once an unpleasant half-orc sailor but was cursed by a sea hag during a voyage. Happi doesn’t provide any game-mechanical benefits, but he would rather be moving around than stuck buried in sand for eternity.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Ice Cold Killer
</summary><p>You were involved in the killing of a villager of Blodvahrer. Legally it may be that you were provoked, but it has gained you a reputation for ruthlessness, bordering on murder.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Twin Destinies
</summary><p>While visiting the town of Bloodvahrer you came across a pair of twins, Yrsa and Gulli, who have arcane abilities. Blodvahrer is not a hospitable place for arcane casters at this time, and when the twins approached you for help in leaving town, you gave it.</p><p>Traveling with the twins, even if for a short while has shown you that their powers are quickly growing in strength, but that unfortunately their control of them is not growing at an equal speed. It did however give you the chance to witness an actual rain of frogs.</p><p>The twins left your company in Olafstaad to be reunited with their father who has joined a group called the Initiates of Flame. What the future holds for these two is anyone’s guess.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Witwulf’s Spellbook
</summary><p>You have retrieved the spellbook of Bronal Witwulf. The spellbook turned out to be an iron warhammer with an inscription that reads, “My Spellbook.” From the archives in Blodvahrer, you have learned that Bronal Witwulf was an adventurer infamous for acts of extreme strength and equally extreme lack of judgement. For a short time, his name featured prominently in the cautionary tales off Gnarhelm, but his fame has completely faded.</p>
