<h2>Story Awards</h2>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Bee-Trusting
</summary><p>Keeping your word, you promised not to reveal to anyone that Marilynth was in Mulmaster nor that she does not want to return to the Sunboughs. Carrying such a secret will earn you Magenta's favor, but her father may not be pleased. He may have something to say to you about it if you cross paths again.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Bee-trayed!
</summary><p>You have decided it is in Marilynth's best interest to advise others of her unwillingness to return to her home. She no longer sees you as kind, trusting heroes, like the ones that once saved her village. Her distrust may manifest in future travels in the Cormanthor Forest.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>BEE-GONE!
</summary><p>The honey is damaged or destroyed. Agent Garz tells you that once the Council of the Blades realizes they do have the entire cargo to give the Thayans, they will want your heads. The Zors, in a veiled act of loyalty, demand you be arrested and flogged in public for dereliction. You must get out of The City of Danger until things blow over. Who knows when that will “bee”.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>
Shadow the Shadows
    <em class="entry-label"> Downtime</em></summary><p>Agent Garz provides you an opportunity to shadow The Secret Police of Mulmaster. You spend many days observing The Hawks investigating crime scenes, conducting stakeouts on persons of interest and answering broadsheet reporter interviews on the The Council of High Blades edicts.</p><p>The experience allows you to spend <strong>5 Downtime Days</strong> to gain Advantage on any <strong>one</strong> Intelligence (Investigation), Wisdom (Perception), or Charisma (Deception) Checks. You can do this <strong>once</strong>.</p><p>You did also learn that The Hawks change their tactics and techniques frequently, so once you used what you have learned, it will no longer be effective. Agent Garz apologizes as you <strong>remove this Downtime Activity from your log</strong>.</p>
