  <h1>Black Blades, Black Wings</h1>
  <h3>Convention Created Content  for Tier 2
    <em class="release"> Released  on November 30, 2017</em>
  </h3><p>As the Zhentarim slowly reoccupy the Citadel of the Raven, they continue to explore the tunnels under the mountain one level at a time. Three tendays ago, a new section of the tunnels broke open, and the first group exploring did not come out. Neither did the second. Nor the third. Unwilling to risk their necks any further, the Zhentarim turn to the other factions for aid in figuring out what threat lies beneath the mountain.</p>

  <h2>Story Awards</h2>
  <details class="story-award">
    <summary>Challenge Coin of the Citadel</summary><p>You have received a challenge coin marking you as a friend of the Citadel of the Raven. It bears the markings of the Citadel on one side of this golden coin, and the symbols of both the Zhentarim and your faction on the other. For members of the Zhentarim, it just holds a singular flying snake. When traveling in the area, showing the coin will, under most circumstances, grant you access to the Citadel and services provided at their regular cost (instead of the 25% markup for outsiders), as well as a night of protection inside its walls, including a bed in the barracks. Up to six companions may accompany you into the Citadel on the strength of your word guaranteeing their good behavior. In the event of any member of your party violating this good conduct oath, you will be stripped of this coin (and any others you and your companions have on you) and cast out into the cold.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="story-award">
    <summary>Chaotic Blessing of the Queen of Spiders</summary><p>You have drawn the attentions of Lloth to you, and she has noticed your prowess in battle. In recognition for slaying the mind flayer masquerading as one of her <em>beloved</em> driders, she has granted you a blessing, but you hardly feel blessed by it. What effect this has on your future adventuring career remains to be seen.</p><p>Additionally, sometimes when you sleep or trance, you have dreams or visions of spiders bursting forth from beneath your skin, demons eating you alive, or your loved ones turning into half-spider monstrosities, but at the end of the vision or dream, you always feel the cool press of Lloth’s lips against your forehead again and you briefly feel that everything will be okay before jerking awake with horror in your eyes. A <em>remove curse</em> cast at 9th level or a <em>wish</em> can end this effect, as can a successful Divine Intervention by a deity not allied to Lloth. At that point, you should strike through this paragraph, but retain the first one.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="story-award">
    <summary>I’ve Fallen but I Got Up</summary><p>Having fallen into a seemingly bottomless crevice and somehow surviving due to the mind flayer’s twisted magic, you gain the flaw “I like jumping off high things that I probably shouldn’t.” A <em>remove curse</em> spell cast on you for the purposes of removing the flaw voids this story award and removes the flaw.</p>
