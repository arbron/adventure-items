    <summary>Hold onto Your Butts!</summary><p>Your character has now seen the following beasts, and if they have the Wild Shape ability and otherwise meet the requirements, they may change into them: allosaurus, pteranodon, axe beak, crocodile, saber-toothed tiger, tiger, and velociraptor.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="story-award">
    <summary>Local Pursuit: Healing the Sick</summary><p>You have spent time working with the healers of Ylraphon to help people recover from the Serpent’s Kiss. Record the story award Local Pursuit: Healing the Sick. Immediately before or after an adventure set in Ylraphon, you may spend 5 downtime days helping the city healers. Once during your next game session after this activity, you may inform your DM you are using this benefit to roll a Wisdom (Medicine) check to stabilize or heal a target as a bonus action instead of an action.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="story-award">
    <summary>Local Pursuit: Metaphysical Studies</summary><p>You have enrolled for tutoring with the mysterious spellcaster known as the Crowngold, though such teaching is sporadic during the brief periods she spends visiting the Old City. This does not affiliate you with the Brixmarsh School of Magic, at which she is a teacher, but her tutoring may be very helpful if you ever pursue related studies or research, and makes your insights into certain subjects more valuable. Immediately before or after an adventure set in Ylraphon, you may spend 3 downtime days receiving the Crowngold’s tutelage. Once during your next game session after this activity, when you grant another character advantage on an Intelligence (Arcana or History) check by assisting them, you may inform your DM you are also using this benefit to roll 1d4 and grant that character a bonus on the Intelligence check equal to the number rolled.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="story-award">
    <summary>Local Pursuit: Part-Time Taverner</summary><p>Your experiences in the Old City brought you into contact with a group of would-be tavern owners looking to found their own place outside the Palisade, who offered to bring you in as a partner. Choose a name for the tavern and record the name as part of this story award (<em>“Local Pursuit: Business Owner (Name of Tavern)”</em>). If you wish, you can write down the same tavern name as other characters who take this story award, making them some of your partners. Immediately before or after an adventure set in Ylraphon, you can spend up to 10 downtime days tending to your business, making use of the “Running a Business” downtime activity described on page 129 of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>, with a maintenance cost of 2 gp per day for your share of expenses. In addition, if you purchase a meal or drink in Ylraphon during an adventure, the price you pay is never higher than the normal price listed in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> (this does not affect lifestyle expenses).</p>
  </details>
  <details class="story-award">
    <summary>Ylraphon Adventurers Guild</summary><p>The Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon is a loose-knit league of “dungeoneers, tomb-robbers, errant crusaders, swashbuckling mercenaries, and sundry formidable scalawags of all races and vocations” (according to its charter). It represents adventurers’ interests in town and helps regulate the profitable exploration of the surrounding ruins.</p><p>To initially join the Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon, a character must speak to Jotan Silverhammer, lieutenant guildmaster and volunteer sergeant of the Town Watch. There is no cost if you discovered the cause of the illness affecting the Old City, or if you obtain one of the <strong>Local Pursuit</strong> story awards, due to your substantial contribution to prosperity of the Old City. Otherwise, initial dues are 50 gp, with additional payments of 12 gp a month. These costs are waived, however, for volunteers either who work three shifts a month for the Town Watch. In game terms, this means a character must spend 50 gp to join, and to remain a member, whenever they spend downtime, they must spend an additional 4 gp for every 10 downtime days they spend (though you may be able to substitute downtime for this cost, see below).</p><p>If a character who owes these dues fails to pay them as soon as they spend downtime, they must pay them by the end of their next game session or they lose all benefits of guild membership, and must pay the 50 gp initial dues again to regain them.</p><p>Members of the Adventurers Guild may delve local ruins in search of treasure. They gain access to the <strong>Guild Delving</strong> downtime activity before or after any adventure set in Ylraphon.</p>
