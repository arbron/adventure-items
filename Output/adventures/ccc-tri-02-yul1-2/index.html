Convention Created Content for Tier 3
  <em class="release">Released by The Role Initiative on November 28, 2017</em></h3>

<p>Elanil Elassidil’s successful recovery brings dire news, and only enough to raise the fears of all. On the urgent request of the factions, a covert raid party must be sent in to secure as much knowledge as possible, and destroy whatever schemes lie below.</p>
<p>Part Two of the <em>Yûlash</em> series.</p>
<h2>Items</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span>Rod of Absorption</span>

<h2>Story Awards</h2>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Harbinger of the Vast Gate
</summary><p>The factions understand the difficulty of the task they asked, but emotions are hard to quell. The Far Realm flesh-magic around the illithid hive terrifies all, as nothing can currently penetrate it. You have been nicknamed a “Harbinger of the Vast Gate” by those who know of your failure, which is spreading by the day.</p><p>As an aftereffect of almost being caught within, your body has been twisted. Far Realm creatures target you first and foremost, wishing to complete your transformation by killing you. Second, if you move to another plane of existence besides the material plane, subtle physical differences are seen. For example, a finger might become a tentacle, or your shadow moves erratically behind you. These changes cannot confer any mechanical bonuses. Those with <em>truesight</em> or other magical means of seeing true forms will see your altered body regardless of your current plane.</p>

<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Honorary Corps Member
</summary><p>Xorack the beholder is in your debt, and the fight against the elder brain Kszanzeth has made him respect you. He offers you a permanent (secondary) position in the Mulmaster Beholder Corps! You will aid them in battle, help them be treated with respect, and many other thing that a lower ranking officer might do. In turn, they will come to your aid when it is most convenient, and allow you to pick a slightly less pompous title than their own. This might come into use in the future…</p>
