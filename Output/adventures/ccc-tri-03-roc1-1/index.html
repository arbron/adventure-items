If the character cannot afford this, roll another d6 and take that result.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Sold into Slavery</td><td>The character is sold into slavery, and branded with a small triangular face tattoo to mark this. Gains a trait of a strong dislike for slavery and empathy for those enslaved.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Impressment</td><td>The character is forced into naval service in Melvaunt as part of their sentence. The character picks up the coarse language and behavior of a sailor.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Hard Time</td><td>Prison almost psychologically breaks the character, but they emerge harder and more cynical, and is prone to sharing stories of his time behind bars.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Prison Break</td><td>Although it takes a long time, the character manages to orchestrate an elaborate prison break, gaining notoriety for their brazen escape.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Better Lucky than Good</td><td>Through a fortunate paperwork mishap, you are instead released from custody instead of placed into it. Some unfortunate soul suffers the opposite bad luck, and now hates you for life.</td></tr></tbody></table>
