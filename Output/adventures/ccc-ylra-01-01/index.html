<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Eldritch Amber Prison
</summary><p>Great misfortune caused you to be trapped and locked away in an eldritch amber prison controlled by the ancient entity called the Tree of Doors. You remain there, alive but in a death-like hibernation, until you are rescued by members of the Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon. Spend <strong>20 downtime days</strong> to wait until you are rescued. If you do not have the downtime days to spend, you are still eventually freed, but whenever you earn downtime during any future adventure, it is immediately spent towards repaying the downtime cost of this story award, until you have spent a total of 20, after which you resume earning downtime normally.</p>

</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Ylraphon Adventurers Guild
</summary><p>The Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon is a loose-knit league of “dungeoneers, tomb-robbers, errant crusaders, swashbuckling mercenaries, and sundry formidable scalawags of all races and vocations” (according to its charter). It represents adventurers’ interests in town and helps regulate the profitable exploration of the surrounding ruins.</p><p>To initially join the Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon, a character must speak to Jotan Silverhammer, lieutenant guildmaster and volunteer sergeant of the Town Watch. There is no cost if you discovered the cause of the illness affecting the Old City, or if you obtain one of the <strong>Local Pursuit</strong> story awards, due to your substantial contribution to prosperity of the Old City. Otherwise, initial dues are 50 gp, with additional payments of 12 gp a month. These costs are waived, however, for volunteers either who work three shifts a month for the Town Watch. In game terms, this means a character must spend 50 gp to join, and to remain a member, whenever they spend downtime, they must spend an additional 4 gp for every 10 downtime days they spend (though you may be able to substitute downtime for this cost, see below).</p><p>If a character who owes these dues fails to pay them as soon as they spend downtime, they must pay them by the end of their next game session or they lose all benefits of guild membership, and must pay the 50 gp initial dues again to regain them.</p><p>Members of the Adventurers Guild may delve local ruins in search of treasure. They gain access to the <strong>Guild Delving</strong> downtime activity before or after any adventure set in Ylraphon.</p>
