  <summary>An Emberstar Exclusive
</summary><p>You’ve gained the favor of Sebastian Emberstar after rescuing his employees from a lynch mob. In gratitude, he grants you an exclusive offer: access to their forges. You have the one-time opportunity to provide your own funds to add decorative flourishes to a weapon you own (gems in the hilt, embossed or filigree in the blades, etc). You can spend any amount, but if you spend at least 10,000 gold, the weapon’s craftsmanship impresses those who view it and know about such things. At the DM’s option, once per adventure you can gain advantage on a Charisma-based ability check by flourishing or displaying the weapon.</p>

<details class="story-award">
  <summary>…A Terrible Thing to Waste
</summary><p>You fell in battle against the minions of a renegade mind flayer. But an adventurer’s brain—even when not taken alive — is a delicacy few mind flayers could resist. Selfless heroics add such a delicious spice! Your story ends here, although your demise spares you from spending your days as a mindless thrall—a fate your compatriots are likely to share.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Ylraphon Adventurers Guild
</summary><p>The Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon is a loose-knit league of “dungeoneers, tomb-robbers, errant crusaders, swashbuckling mercenaries, and sundry formidable scalawags of all races and vocations” (according to its charter). It represents adventurers’ interests in town and helps regulate the profitable exploration of the surrounding ruins.</p><p>To initially join the Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon, a character must speak to Jotan Silverhammer, lieutenant guildmaster and volunteer sergeant of the Town Watch. There is no cost if you discovered the cause of the illness affecting the Old City, or if you obtain one of the <strong>Local Pursuit</strong> story awards, due to your substantial contribution to prosperity of the Old City. Otherwise, initial dues are 50 gp, with additional payments of 12 gp a month. These costs are waived, however, for volunteers either who work three shifts a month for the Town Watch. In game terms, this means a character must spend 50 gp to join, and to remain a member, whenever they spend downtime, they must spend an additional 4 gp for every 10 downtime days they spend (though you may be able to substitute downtime for this cost, see below).</p><p>If a character who owes these dues fails to pay them as soon as they spend downtime, they must pay them by the end of their next game session or they lose all benefits of guild membership, and must pay the 50 gp initial dues again to regain them.</p><p>Members of the Adventurers Guild may delve local ruins in search of treasure. They gain access to the <strong>Guild Delving</strong> downtime activity before or after any adventure set in Ylraphon.</p>
