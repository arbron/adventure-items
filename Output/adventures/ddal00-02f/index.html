        <div class="content"><section><h1>The Definition of Heroism</h1><h3>Season Agnostic Adventure for Tier 4<em class="release"> Released  on July 12, 2018</em></h3><p>Myth Drannor lies under a layer of debris that is nearly a quarter-mile thick. But there are secrets in the chaos, and some of those secrets yearn to be made known once more. Within the rubble of Thultanthar and Myth Drannor can be heard ethereal voices—but of what they speak, no sane mind has yet to report.</p><h2>Items</h2><p><ul><li><span>Quaryl’s Codex (Tome of the Stilled Tongue)</span><em class="entry-label"> Legendary</em></li></ul></p><h2>Spellbooks</h2><p><ul><li><strong>Quaryl's Spellbook: </strong><em class="entry-label">Contains a single spell you don't currently know. Spellbook will be returned to Quaryl's lair ten days after being removed, but the spell can be copied down like normal.</em></li></ul></p><h2>Story Awards</h2><details class="story-award"><summary>Larloch’s Unblinking Gaze</summary><p>“The warlock”—in truth, the Netherese lich Larloch—has taken an interest in you. You have already discovered that he can control undead creatures with but a thought and that he has a significant understanding of the way that the Weave works. This may work for or against you in future encounters with Larloch and his agents.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Lore of the Ages</summary><p>The corrupted lorenorn Quaryl Tellasarim had amassed a wealth of arcane knowledge over the years. The tomes are worth a fair amount to collectors, but as they are first-hand accounts of direct interactions with the Weave the scholars and acolytes of Candlekeep would give a counter offer: a tenday of access to the great library’s vast resources in exchange for a full set of 6 tomes of a given school of magic. Alternately, you can turn in 3 sets of tomes in to Candlekeep in exchange for a 7th-level spell scroll of your choosing from an Adventurers League-approved source.</p><p>If you attempt to surrender forgeries or duplicate copies to the acolytes at Candlekeep they will quickly discover your ruse. You will be ejected from Candlekeep until such time as you make a 10,000 gp donation or discover another campaign-approved method of removing this penalty.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Myth Drannor Explorer</summary><p>You have entered the ruins of Myth Drannor and survived to tell the tale. While this is still considered a holy place for elves across Faerûn, others may be keenly interested in hearing of your exploits. When you stay at a tavern in a large city (such as the Yawning Portal in Waterdeep), you may make a DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check; if successful your drinks and lodging are paid for by the other patrons. If unsuccessful, you are stuck with the bar tab for everyone that night.</p><p>High-ranking elves may have a dim view of your unsanctioned activities in Myth Drannor. At your DM’s discretion, your Charisma-based skill checks are made with disadvantage when dealing with elf nobles and very strong spellcasters.</p></details></section></div>
