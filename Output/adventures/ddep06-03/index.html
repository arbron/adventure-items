A great and awful host of drow, giants, and worse await your arrival. When even the dead tremble, what hope can you find?</p><h2>Items</h2><p><ul><li><span>Amulet of the Planes</span><span class="entry-label">Very Rare</span></li><li><span>Blessing of Protection</span><span class="entry-label">Unique</span></li><li><span>Candle of Invocation</span><span class="entry-label">Very Rare</span></li><li><span>Charm of Vitality</span><span class="entry-label">Unique</span></li><li><span>Cloak of Invisibility</span><span class="entry-label">Legendary</span></li></ul></p><h2>Story Awards</h2><details class="story-award"><summary>Consumed by Kiaransalee</summary><p>You faced the drow goddess Kiaransalee until the bitter end. However, she won—you were utterly destroyed and your soul was consumed. If you had clones or contingencies, these fail to activate.</p><p>You cannot be resurrected or otherwise returned to life until another character spends 100 downtime days searching the planes of existence for you and also spends 200,000 gp in bribes and resources with greater demons and elder powers. This bargaining is exhausting for all parties involved, but if you are returned to life you do so with a deeper understanding of this menace: you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects from clerics of Kiaransalee—and Kiaransalee herself!</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Faction Savior</summary><p>You were directly responsible for the safety of one or more faction leaders. They are incredibly thankful, and wish to reward you. If you share a faction with that faction master, you may receive a <em>true resurrection</em> for free (including downtime days). If you do not share faction membership with them, they will cover half of the gold piece fee of a <em>true resurrection</em>. You may only receive one free casting of the spell in this manner, but the discount applies for each faction master that you directly saved.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Gatekeeper of the Divine</summary><p>SEER’s teleportation circle allowed a large host of angelic solars and planetars to temporarily enter Faerun. These creatures represent the pinnacle of the lawful good alignment, and some of their qualities have rubbed off on you. You desire to pursue the greater good whenever possible and wish to work within the limits of the law. Though you are not beholden to these desires, they are strong. If you change your alignment to lawful good (or are already there), you have advantage on Charisma checks with solars, planetars, and lawful good clerics and paladins.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Lost Lore of the Illithilich</summary><p>The drow lich that had been serving as the focal point of the necromantic ritual in the Underdark is destroyed, and upon your return to the surface you find that one of her still- wriggling fingers (or toes) can be found in one of your packs. No matter what you do to get rid of it, it always comes back a few days later. It’s been said that liches have more power in their fingers than most mortals will ever know, and this is no exception: you can use this appendage while casting a spell in order to impose disadvantage on the spell target’s saving throw. Once used in this manner, the appendage crumbles into dust and cannot be reconstructed by any means, including <em>wish</em>.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Patron of the Company</summary><p>You managed to convince the drow mercenary company Bregan D’Arthe to turn their back on the conflict. This cost no small amount of gold, and word of your actions will spread. While the mercenaries themselves are discreet about their funding, there were other ears and eyes in the Underdark that day. What this means for you will remain to be seen.</p></details></section></div>
