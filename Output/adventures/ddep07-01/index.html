Dastardly ne'er‐do‐wells have been spotted just outside of the harbor! Not content with scratching a living off of the rich port city’s scraps, pirates are making for the city by land and sea. But Port Nyanzaru is far from defenseless; pick up a yklwah, climb aboard a dinosaur, or man the wall; but whatever you do, don’t let those rapscallions into the city!</p><h2>Items</h2><p><ul><li><span>Cloak of the Bat</span><em class="entry-label">Rare</em></li><li><span>Eversmoking Bottle</span><em class="entry-label">Uncommon</em></li><li><span>Leather Armor, +1</span><em class="entry-label">Rare</em></li><li><span>Shortsword, +1</span><em class="entry-label">Uncommon</em></li><li><span>Staff of the Woodlands</span><em class="entry-label">Rare</em></li><li><span>Trident, +1</span><em class="entry-label">Uncommon</em></li><li>10 x <span>Alchemist's fire (flask)</span><em class="entry-label">Common</em></li><li>2 x <span>Antitoxin (vial)</span><em class="entry-label">Common</em></li><li>1 x <span>Healer's kit</span><em class="entry-label">Common</em></li><li>1 x <span>Potion of Clairvoyance</span><em class="entry-label">Rare</em></li><li>4 x <span>Potion of Healing</span><em class="entry-label">Common</em></li><li>4 x <span>Potion of Superior Healing</span><em class="entry-label">Rare</em></li></ul></p><h2>Story Awards</h2><details class="story-award"><summary>Alliance Black Operative</summary><p>You’ve proven to your superiors in the Lords’ Alliance that you can get things done: even if it means breaking the law. Now the nobility turn to you under cover of night with dark deeds in mind.</p><p>Between adventures, you can spend ten downtime days to carry out a covert Lords’ Alliance contract and gain one renown with your faction. You may only perform this activity once between each adventure you play.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Barnacles the Parrot</summary><p>You own a trained <strong>parrot</strong> called “Barnacles”. Barnacles knows many saucy nautical phrases and has the uncanny ability to detect lies.</p><p>You can use Barnacles’ Wisdom (Insight) modifier of +4 in addition to your own when attempting to detect lies. If Barnacles smells a rat, he’ll squawk one of the following phrases: “Thar she blows!”, “Hang ‘em from the yardarm!”, or “Blow the man down!”.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Eye-Patch</summary><p>You lost an eye while trying to steal from Port Nyanzaru’s merchants, and now wear a leather patch over your gaping eye socket. If you lift the patch, you can double your proficiency modifier in the Intimidation skill.</p><p>You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on ranged attack rolls. Magic such as the <em>regenerate</em> spell can restore the lost eye and remove this story award.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Flying Snake</summary><p>You’ve unmasked the merchant prince Ifan Talro’a as a criminal. For now, the Emerald Enclave is sitting on the information, choosing to monitor the prince rather than show their hand. As reward, they’ve given you a trained <strong>flying snake</strong> to serve as your messenger.</p><p>Once per adventure, you can attach a message to the flying snake and send it to one of your allies. This functions as an <em>animal messenger</em> spell, but the message can only be sent to people you know.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Hero of Port Nyanzaru</summary><p>You helped the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru defeat Captain Smoke’s pirate armada, and you’re now known as a hero throughout the city.</p><p>You gain advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with the merchant princes. If you start a session within Port Nyanzaru, you gain advantage on the first attack roll or saving throw that you make.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Hook for a Hand</summary><p>A pirate chopped off your hand, and you replaced it with a rusty hook. Your unarmed attacks now deal 1d6 piercing damage.</p><p>While you wear the hook, you can hold only a single object at a time. You have disadvantage on attacks made with weapons that use two hands. Magic such as the <em>regenerate</em> spell can restore the lost appendage and remove this story award.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Map of the Jungle</summary><p>You rescued Gordo the Just from the clutches of Captain Walharrow. In return, he gifted you a fragment of a rare map of the jungle.</p><p>The <em>Tomb of Annihilation</em> hardcover adventure provides an unfinished map of Chult. At any time, you can strike through this story award to reveal map details in a 2‐hex diameter from any point on the map you choose. Alternatively, you can strike through this story award to succeed on any check made to navigate through jungle terrain.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Peg Leg</summary><p>You lost your foot in a tomb beneath Port Nyanzaru, and wear a wooden peg leg in its place. Your peg leg has a hidden compartment that’s ideal for concealing a coin purse or a set of thieves’ tools.</p><p>While you wear the peg leg, your speed on foot is halved and you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Magic such as the <em>regenerate</em> spell can restore the lost appendage and remove this story award.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Pirate’s Curse</summary><p>You failed to protect Port Nyanzaru from Captain Smoke’s pirate armada. As a parting shot, the pirates cursed you from beyond the grave.</p><p>You gain disadvantage on the first attack roll or saving throw you make during a session. Only a <em>remove curse</em> spell or similar magic can dispel the curse and remove this story award.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Uku the Spider Boy</summary><p>A naughty <strong>flying monkey</strong> called “Uku the Spider Boy” has latched onto you. Uku (“OO‐koo”) wears a crimson waistcoat adorned with tiny mirrors and sports a silk skullcap. He has a naturally mischievous nature.</p><p>Uku can smell gold from 30 feet away, even if it’s kept inside a purse or container. As an action, you can command Uku to steal or retrieve up to 100gp using his Sleight of Hand skill bonus of +4. Uku keeps 10% of the takings, which he spends on boiled sweets next time you’re in town.</p></details></section></div>
