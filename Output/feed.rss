This has no effect on other creatures, or on devils that are devoted to an archdevil other than Zariel. You do not need to be a cleric to use this ability, nor do you need to wield a holy symbol—when you perform this profane rite, Bel’s sigil materializes above your head and glows with purple light.</td></tr><tr><td>5 Hit Dice</td><td>Bel delivers one common or uncommon permanent magic item to you. This item does not count against your magic item limit, and you may use this item for one hour at which time it crumbles to dust as it is reclaimed by the archdevil.</td></tr><tr><td>8 Hit Dice</td><td>Bel delivers one rare magic permanent magic item to you, or one uncommon consumable magic item.

  <h3>Season 9 Epic for Tiers 1 and 2

  </h3><p>On this holy day (tribute to Leira and Mask), folk of all walks of life don masks and costumes to disguise themselves and play at being other than what they are. Festivities begin in the evening, when candles are placed in hollowed-out pumpkins carved with faces. Tricks and pranks of all kinds are common on this night, and pickpockets are rife on this day, so few carry much coin with them, having secreted it away somewhere the previous evening. Instead, people fill their pockets and belt pouches with candies. Come celebrate with us on the darkened streets of Baldur’s Gate.</p>

  <h2>Story Awards</h2>
  <details class="story-award">
    <summary>Private in Pipyap’s Legion</summary><p>Pipyap prefers to enlist wayward devils into his crew, but a devil you know did him a solid, and he didn’t really have any other way of repaying them. As such, he’s infused you with a bit of his own Infernal nature. You gain proficiency in Infernal. In addition, if you’re hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren’t silvered until the end of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you’ve completed a long rest. This story award may only be applied to the character who gained the level awarded above.</p><p>This boon isn’t without cost, however. Pipyap may come calling and refusing his call may have dire consequences, indeed.</p>
