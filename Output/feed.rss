Now, a new owner hopes to reopen the hospital, but first the ghost must be exorcised. Can you help the child find peace at last?</p>

    </summary><p>The howling winds of Icewind Dale keep many things secret and hidden from the prying eyes of the world. For instance, the Netherese temple dedicated to Jergal, the ancient god of death, has lain dormant and alone for many hundreds of years. But you're an adventurer and when an opportunity arises to investigate (and loot!) the temples of old, you rise to the occasion. And this time was no exception—your deeds inspired the echoes of a lost god and you now find yourself in the (somewhat unenviable) position of being caretaker of his agent.</p>
