Your soul is now forfeit; if you die, you can only be restored to life via a <em>wish</em> or <em>true resurrection</em> spell, after which you can remove this award.

However, Bel has granted you some special powers in exchange for this self-sacrifice:</p><p><strong>Bel's Blessings</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Cost</th><th>Benefit</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 Hit Die</td><td>Reroll a failed saving throw or an attack roll that missed its target.</td></tr><tr><td>2 Hit Dice</td><td>You grow leathery wings and a flight speed of 20 ft. for 1 minute.</td></tr><tr><td>3 Hit Dice</td><td>You may spend a bonus action to turn devils that are faithful to Zariel as if they were undead and you were using the Channel Divinity: Turn Undead cleric class feature. This has no effect on other creatures, or on devils that are devoted to an archdevil other than Zariel. You do not need to be a cleric to use this ability, nor do you need to wield a holy symbol—when you perform this profane rite, Bel’s sigil materializes above your head and glows with purple light.</td></tr><tr><td>5 Hit Dice</td><td>Bel delivers one common or uncommon permanent magic item to you. This item does not count against your magic item limit, and you may use this item for one hour at which time it crumbles to dust as it is reclaimed by the archdevil.</td></tr><tr><td>8 Hit Dice</td><td>Bel delivers one rare magic permanent magic item to you, or one uncommon consumable magic item. This item does not count against your magic item limit, and you may use this item for one hour at which time it crumbles to dust as it is reclaimed by the archdevil.</td></tr></tbody></table>

  <h1>Liar's Night</h1>
  <h3>Season 9 Epic for Tiers 1 and 2
    <em class="release"> Released  on October 31, 2019</em>
  </h3><p>On this holy day (tribute to Leira and Mask), folk of all walks of life don masks and costumes to disguise themselves and play at being other than what they are. Festivities begin in the evening, when candles are placed in hollowed-out pumpkins carved with faces. Tricks and pranks of all kinds are common on this night, and pickpockets are rife on this day, so few carry much coin with them, having secreted it away somewhere the previous evening. Instead, people fill their pockets and belt pouches with candies. Come celebrate with us on the darkened streets of Baldur’s Gate.</p>

  <details class="story-award">
    <summary>Private in Pipyap’s Legion</summary><p>Pipyap prefers to enlist wayward devils into his crew, but a devil you know did him a solid, and he didn’t really have any other way of repaying them. As such, he’s infused you with a bit of his own Infernal nature. You gain proficiency in Infernal. In addition, if you’re hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren’t silvered until the end of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you’ve completed a long rest. This story award may only be applied to the character who gained the level awarded above.</p><p>This boon isn’t without cost, however. Pipyap may come calling and refusing his call may have dire consequences, indeed.</p>
