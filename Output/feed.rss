    </summary><p>The howling winds of Icewind Dale keep many things secret and hidden from the prying eyes of the world. For instance, the Netherese temple dedicated to Jergal, the ancient god of death, has lain dormant and alone for many hundreds of years. But you're an adventurer and when an opportunity arises to investigate (and loot!) the temples of old, you rise to the occasion. And this time was no exception—your deeds inspired the echoes of a lost god and you now find yourself in the (somewhat unenviable) position of being caretaker of his agent.</p>

Raw chaos and incarnate evil flows through your body, warping it into the monster that your nightmares feared might dwell within. As you change, the layer responds to suit your whims, twisting with newfound corruption. You are forever retired from D&amp;D Adventurers League play and you cannot be returned by any means. This character’s story has ended for you, but your friends have gained a powerful new enemy who knows them all too well.</p>

  </details>
  <details class="story-award">
    <summary>Tipping the Balance</summary><p>You have drastically altered the balance of the Blood War, potentially bringing about the end of reality. All devils bare you a grudge and you make all Charisma checks against fiends at disadvantage. In addition, they no longer answer your call. All spells or abilities that summon a devil automatically fail.</p>

    <summary>Banned: Stygia</summary><p>The frozen, inhospitable wilderness of Stygia is home to many vile creatures as well as an uncountable number from the Material Plane. Desperate criminals and those condemned to death may pray to Levistus, the ruler of Stygia, for freedom; should he answer, they are transported here. For reasons known only to you and him, you are forever banned from setting foot within Stygia. Perhaps you redeemed too many souls, or maybe you were discovered to be in league with Geryon, the former ruler of this realm; regardless, Levistus has closed this layer of the Nine Hells to you. You can’t participate in further adventures in this place.</p><p>A character with this story award may visit other areas of the Nine Hells but has been banned from Stygia.</p>
