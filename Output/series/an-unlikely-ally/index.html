<p>Since the end of the red war in Mulmaster, the factions have been nursing their wounds. They no longer have the resources and pull to send large groups of adventures to retake a city or overthrow a government. Reduced to posting handbills the factions have located a secret dungeon that may hold the secret to regaining a measure of their status and power in the Moonsea. You have all arrived at the call of these handbills that promise powerful magics and rewards if you can succeed.</p>
