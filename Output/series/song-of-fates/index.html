<h3>
  <a href="/adventures/ccc-tarot-01-01">Awakening of Fates</a>
  <em class="adventure-code">CCC-TAROT-01-01</em></h3>
<p>The food shortages in Thentia have gotten worse. The crops aren’t producing as much, and with the Harvest Festival approaching, the government of Thentia is seeking people to investigate the farmlands to find the cause. Popular belief says that there are monstrous beings rampaging the farms, but other powers are afoot…</p>
<h3>
  <a href="/adventures/ccc-tarot-01-02">By the Light of the Moon</a>
  <em class="adventure-code">CCC-TAROT-01-02</em></h3>
<p>Storms batter Thentia and the rains are threatening to wash away what little farm land is available. But these are not the only storms to threaten the peace as various powers wage a quiet struggle around the city. Are you brave enough to become an Agent of the Fates?</p>
<h3>
  <a href="/adventures/ccc-tarot-01-03">A Martyred Heart</a>
  <em class="adventure-code">CCC-TAROT-01-03</em></h3>
<p>As Thentia’s lighthouse grows dim so too does faith within the city. In the midst of this a priest of Ilmater has been accused of a heinous crime. But is this really the truth of the matter, or are we all just Agents of Fate?</p>
<h3>
  <a href="/adventures/ccc-tarot-01-04">Tangled Woods</a>
  <em class="adventure-code">CCC-TAROT-01-04</em></h3>
<p>The normally joyous festival of Highharvestide fast approaches the Moonsea but denizens of Thentia are not celebrating. Thanks to recent bad harvests along the River Thent and an increasingly impassible harbor, famine looms. Survival may depend on the arrival of every single larder-laden wagon. Could more trouble than bandits stand between the farmers and the walls of Thentia this season?</p>

<p>Election time in Thentia is here! With the recent, strange events surrounding Thentia, there is a tense contest for the seat of Watchlord of Thentia. The town has divided itself into factions supporting their candidates, and with that, the people ahve been very hostile to each other. On election day, certain key figureheads in the town need to vote, but might need some help getting there…</p>
<h3>
  <a href="/adventures/ccc-tarot-s1-01">A Long Night</a>

<h3>
  <a href="/adventures/ccc-tarot-02-04">Moonlit Waves, Part 1</a>
  <em class="adventure-code">CCC-TAROT-02-04</em></h3>
