If a misfire occurs, the bullet doesn’t discharge and the powder flashes, blinding the shooter until the end of its next turn.\n\n There are three silvered shot bullets, and just enough smoke powder left for each one. These shots may only be used during a Moonshae Isle adventure. If the character plays an adventure outside of the Moonshae Isles, the powder goes bad and is no longer usable.\n\n This item comes from another world and works unlike any other. Ammo and powder cannot be crafted for it. Once the three shots are used, or the powder goes bad, it becomes a mundane object and may never be operated again. It cannot be duplicated magically. **This is NOT a magic item**.\n\n The blunderbuss is a recognized item in the Moonshae region.
