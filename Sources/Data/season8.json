Brewed from the blue lichen grown on the skeletons of dwarves left for dead in the Stonebone Mines, bluetooth ale is a truly unique beverage.\n\n The strong dwarven-style ale is a rich sapphire color and has a faint earthy taste. While the ale lacks most of the special properties of the blue lichen, it still can turn the imbibers teeth (and bones) temporarily blue.\n\n The ale functions as an ingested poison. The drinker must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, or their skeleton turns a dark shade of blue for 24 hours."
