This has no effect on other creatures, or on devils that are devoted to an archdevil other than Zariel. You do not need to be a cleric to use this ability, nor do you need to wield a holy symbol—when you perform this profane rite, Bel’s sigil materializes above your head and glows with purple light. |\n| 5 Hit Dice | Bel delivers one common or uncommon permanent magic item to you. This item does not count against your magic item limit, and you may use this item for one hour at which time it crumbles to dust as it is reclaimed by the archdevil. |\n| 8 Hit Dice | Bel delivers one rare magic permanent magic item to you, or one uncommon consumable magic item.
