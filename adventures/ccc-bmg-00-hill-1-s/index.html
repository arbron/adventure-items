The forces of evil have established traitors inside the city, have stolen secret defense plans, and have some secret allies preparing to join the assault. The forces of good have only brave adventurers willing to die for their cause.</p><h2>Items</h2><p><ul><li>5 x <span>Potion of Greater Healing</span><span class="entry-label">Uncommon</span></li><li>5 x <span>Potion of Healing</span><span class="entry-label">Common</span></li></ul></p><h2>Story Awards</h2><details class="story-award"><summary>Knight of the Plume</summary><p>For bravery in the face of overwhelming odds, you have been awarded the title of “Knight of the Plume, Protector of Hillsfar.” This new-found order has established by First Lord Vuhm Yestral of Hillsfar, and you are the first group to have been awarded this honor. While within the jurisdiction of Hillsfar, you can expect to be addressed with the honorific “Sir” or “Lady” depending on your preference. The doors of Hillsfar Castle are open to you, and you can get lodging and a meal there.</p><p>In addition, you have been titled with a small plot of barren land on the outskirts of Hillsfar, outside the city walls. The land is currently in bad shape, as the armies of the dark fey have ravaged it while approaching Hillsfar. The deed and title to this land can be held for as long as the character is alive, but it cannot be transferred to anyone else. In addition, because of the current political unrest in Hillsfar, no development can take place on this land until this character earns another story award which allows for development of the land.</p><p>In return for the title and the land, you are expected to act in a manner befitting the title, especially when you are representing Hillsfar to people outside of Hillsfar and the Moonsea region. Reports of questionable behavior getting back to the leaders of Hillsfar could result in having this honor rescinded.</p></details></section></div>
