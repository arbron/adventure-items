With danger closing in, someone has to investigate.</p><h2>Items</h2><p><ul><li><span>Emerald Kidgloves (Gloves of Thievery)</span><em class="entry-label">Uncommon</em></li><li>2 x <span>Potion of Healing</span><em class="entry-label">Common</em></li></ul></p><h2>Story Awards</h2><details class="story-award"><summary>Enmity of the Cloisternooks</summary><p>You have done something to grievously wound the gnomish Cloisternook family. Perhaps you insulted their honor, or perhaps you caused irreparable damage to Darkglitter Depths. Maybe you even sold one of them into slavery. Word travels fast in the gnomish communities, though, and as a result you have disadvantage on all social skill checks when dealing with Cloisternook gnomes and clerics of Gond.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Feast of the Hound</summary><p>The corrupted machine deep in the Darkglitter Depths drew in your essence, and in those terrifying final moments you saw something: an emaciated hound, gargantuan in size, feasting upon the souls of those that arrived before you. It gleefully tore them asunder, and then turned to you. As its teeth sank into your metaphysical flesh and you felt the hot stink of its breath wash over you, you were pulled back to the world—but not without a reminder: you have the scars of a dog’s bite somewhere on your body, and sometimes those scars stink and fester when in the presence of clerics and paladins.</p></details></section></div>
