To what extent are they involved? Is there still a threat? The Mages have pledged their cooperation in your investigation, but are they sincere? Try to find the answers to these difficult questions and earn the respect of some powerful allies in the city of Hillsfar.</p><h2>Items</h2><p><ul><li><span>Widowmaker (Crossbow, +1)</span><em class="entry-label">Uncommon</em></li></ul></p><h2>Story Awards</h2><details class="story-award"><summary>Enmity in Hillsfar</summary><p>The citizens of Hillsfar don’t take kindly to being pushed around. They have started to report your movements and activities to your foes. As a result, whenever you are adventuring in the Hillsfar region, your enemies have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks used to determine surprise. The Story Reward “A Favor of Rogues” or “Savior of Hillsfar” can be used to negate the effects of this Story Reward.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Friend of the Mage’s Guild</summary><p>If you’re in Hillsfar and need some help with a magical problem and have time to bring it to the Mage’s Guild, you gain advantage on any check that deals with Arcana once per session. Also, any future interactions with members of the Hillsfar Mage’s Guild that require skill checks have advantage.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Friend of the Rogue’s Guild</summary><p>If you’re in Hillsfar and need some help with getting information about people or places in and around the city, you can reach out to the Rogue’s Guild once per session and gain advantage on that check. Also, any future interactions with members of the Hillsfar Rogue’s Guild that require skill checks have advantage.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>You’ve Got a Friend in Me</summary><p>The Zulkir remembers his debts and debtors and spreads word through the Red Wizard channels that you are a friend of Thay.
