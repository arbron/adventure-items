The ones behind the mages and thieves guild being implicated in an assassination attempt of the Zulkir. All that’s needed is a group of upstanding ne’re do wells to help the First Lord deal with the situation.</p><h2>Items</h2><p><ul><li><span>Achis Atracta (Periapt of Proof against Poison)</span><em class="entry-label"> Rare</em></li><li><span class="illegal">Philter of Love</span><em class="entry-label"> Not AL Legal</em></li></ul></p><h2>Story Awards</h2><details class="story-award"><summary>A Favor of Rogues</summary><p>For saving Isthana Ro, the Rogue’s Guild of Hillsfar owes the characters a favor. If the characters ever need a hand while in Hillsfar, or anytime Isthana Ro or a member of the Rogue’s Guild of Hillsfar is around and can be asked for help, they gain advantage on a check as if they used the aid action or can provide information they would know as if they rolled a 20 on the Knowledge check. After this has been used once it goes away.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Hapless in Hillsfar</summary><p>The failure of the characters has reverberated throughout Hillsfar, and any time the characters make a check dealing with the people of Hillsfar they have disadvantage until they succeed at an adventure and regain the faith of the people of Hillsfar.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Lover’s Enmity</summary><p>For stealing Achis Atracta from him, Martek Leer swears eternal vengeance upon all the characters bearing this Story Award. The eyes of Martek’s agents are always upon these characters when in Hillsfar. Once for each adventure played or each Downtime day spent in Hillsfar, roll a d20. On a 1, the DM may select to turn any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check the character makes into a 1 as Martek’s agents interfere. This Story Award has further consequences in future adventures!</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Take Care of Her</summary><p>Because of his failure to protect her, Martek Leer has entrusted Achis Atracta to your care—as her new bearer or companion—and tearfully wishes you a wonderful future together. His love-filled well-wishes bear a special kind of luck. Once for each adventure played in Hillsfar, you can invoke that luck to add 1d4 to any d20 roll you make. You can apply this Story Award after you make the roll, but before the results are known.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>You’ve Got a Friend in Me</summary><p>The Zulkir remembers his debts and debtors and spreads word through the Red Wizard channels that you are a friend of Thay. You receive advantage on all ability checks throughout the rest of <strong>HILL2-2</strong> and <strong>HILL2-3</strong> in dealing with the Red Wizards. Each module has this Story Award and if a character receives three ranks of this, the effect is permanent in any dealings with the Red Wizards of Thay.</p></details></section></div>
