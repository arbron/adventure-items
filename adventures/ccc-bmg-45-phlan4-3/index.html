His whereabouts have been narrowed, so your task is simple; bring him in, dead or alive. But how does one capture a living nightmare? Can you face your darkest fears? Do you have the courage? It will be more difficult than you think.</p>

It holds psychic knowledge of the colony as it existed when the ring was taken from its illithid owner. As long as you possess this ring, the colony will attempt to recover it by hunting you down.

  <summary>
State of the Quassine
    <em class="entry-label"> Downtime</em></summary><p>By spending <strong>three downtime days</strong> in study, the possessor of the Quassine signet ring may learn the following information:</p><p><em>The Quassine colony of illithids is a new colony that has recently broken free of their elder brain and are under the leadership of the ulitharid, Lord Vathrax. Their prized possession is a nautiloid ship and they will do anything to protect it. Vathrax, much like Kaidan, became intrigued by the monk’s studies, and the power held by Phryne. Assuming they can get her to move it into another plane, they also covet the monastery as a location suitable for Vathrax’s transition to an Elder Brain.</em></p>
