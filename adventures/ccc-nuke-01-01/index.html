    <em class="entry-label"> Downtime</em></summary><p>At the end of the adventure the player can use the following downtime activity. The players can spend <strong>ten downtime days</strong> to wait for Elder Filaeren Xilofane to recover and to speak to him.</p><p>Elder Xilofane, upon hearing of your effort to eradicate the source of the sickness that befell his people, has his faith in the alliance of elves and men bolstered.</p><p>For Emerald Enclave affiliated players: If Xilofane has not committed to joining the Emerald Enclave, he does so now, accepting the pin and signing the letter of recruitment.</p><p>For Zhentarim affiliated players: Xilofane convinces the gambler Durgin Lodepips to accept any offers to escort him back to Mulmaster. If the Zhentarim characters did not complete their faction assignment, they do so now.</p><p>If the players spending downtime days in the above manner were not rewarded the Story Reward, “A Jar of Gratitude” during the adventures, then they are at this time.</p><p>In addition, any player that uses this downtime activity is able to take advantage of the sanctity and seclusion of Sunboughs. You enjoy room and board at a Modest Lifestyle with no costs, and you can complete any <strong>one</strong> downtime activity (other than this one) at half the downtime day costs and expenses.</p><p>Whether you use the activity to complete faction objectives or take advantage of the secluded locale to study, once you have used this downtime activity, you can no longer gain its benefit.</p>

<details class="story-award">
  <summary>A Jar of Gratitude
</summary><p>The adventurer’s actions have saved the villagers of Sunboughs and strengthened ties between the Lord’s Alliance and the Sunboughs people. Each character is gifted a small jar of the coveted Sunbough Honey. They are told that since this batch has not yet settled, it will be some time before its true flavors can be realized. Until that time, having it in your possession will make for a “sweet” story piece and may bring the attention of curious others that wonder how YOU obtained it.</p>

<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Magenta’s Thanks
</summary><p>The daughter of Filaeren Xilofane wraps a silk scarf around the neck of one player. The magenta-hued scarf looks gaudy, but it is stitched with golden thread. The Sunboughs Sigil of a woodland wreath with a honeycomb at its center is embroidered into the scarf. Being in possession of the scarf identifies its owner as a friend of the wood elves of the Sunboughs, which may come in handy in future adventurers in the region.</p>

<details class="story-award">
  <summary>The Sting of the Zors
</summary><p>Word of your transgressions in The Sunboughs “matter” have reached the ears of The Zors of Mulmaster. For the slight to their reputation, you and anyone in your party (while you are present) may find yourselves shunned by the Zors in any dealings you may have in the City of Danger, or in the Moonsea Region for that matter. Their influence is far-reaching…and they do not forget.</p>
