  <h2>Story Awards</h2>
  <details class="story-award">
    <summary>Crown Jewels</summary><p>Talindra’s Brooch is an exquisite piece of artwork. A silver dragon curls around a piece of amethyst. A fleck of ruby is set in the dragons eye, a circle of gold enclosing the whole piece. It is a piece of jewelry fit for Cormyrian royalty. They will be very glad to get it back.</p><p>The jeweler to whom you sought to sell the piece to immediately closes his shop and sends out his assistant while he appraises the piece. He hems and haws over the value, checking ledgers and showing you drawings of other pieces and what those pieces sold for in comparison. But he does not have to stall long; the assistant returns with a full company of the watch in short order. They even bring magical support.</p><p>You spend the next three days in jail, as you plead your innocence and deny all knowledge that the brooch had been stolen from the Corymyrian Royal Vaults. Apparently, it was quite the theft. The most powerful divination magic of Cormyr’s famed wizard college failed to turn up any clues. But eventually your story checks out. The staff at Hofstead’s beacon confirm that a woman matching Talindra’s description was pulled from the wreck and went with the other survivors to Mulmaster.</p><p>From Mulmaster the trail goes cold. No one there remembers seeing her, even though you spend several days and no small amount of gold trying to locate her. Even divination magic fails. She has slipped through your grasp for now. But the Cormyrian authorities remain wary of you and circulate your description.</p><p><em>When you get this story award, immediately deduct five downtime days and 25 gold pieces from your character. Until another story award instructs otherwise, you have disadvantage on all Charisma checks with Cormyrian officials.</em></p><p><strong>This is a Cormyrian Heist story award.</strong></p>

  <details class="story-award">
    <summary>Language Tutor Corbin Tusslefoot</summary><p>Corbin Tusslefoot, traveler and linguist owes you his life. In gratitude, he will suspend his travels and waives his usual fees to help you learn a new language. Corbin speaks and can tutor you in Dwarvish, Elven, Giant, and Draconic.</p><p>Normally it costs 250 downtime days to learn a new language. With the help of a language tutor you may learn a new language by spending only 200 downtime days. Alternatively, if you already have another means of reducing the number of downtime days required to learn a language, such as a faction benefit, you may reduce the cost by 25 days. You may use multiple language tutors to reduce the cost of learning a language, but each tutor may only help you learn a particular language once. If you earn multiple copies of a particular language tutor award, that tutor may help you learn one new language for each instance of the award you have. Use of a language tutor story award may not reduce the cost to learn a language to less than 100 downtime days.</p>
