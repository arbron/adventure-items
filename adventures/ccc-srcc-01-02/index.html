  <summary>Local Pursuit: Healing the Sick
</summary><p>You have spent time working with the healers of Ylraphon to help people recover from the Serpent’s Kiss. Record the story award <em>Local Pursuit: Healing the Sick</em>. Immediately before or after an adventure set in Ylraphon, you may spend 5 downtime days helping the city healers. Once during your next game session after this activity, you may inform your DM you are using this benefit to roll a Wisdom (Medicine) check to stabilize a target within 5 feet as a bonus action instead of an action.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Local Pursuit: Swamp Guide
</summary><p>Your experience navigating the shifting landscape of the Flooded Forest can be put to good use guiding others who need to travel through that deadly wilderness. Repeated return trips to the area give you an instinctive for keeping your footing on treacherous terrain. Record the story award <em>Local Pursuit: Swamp Guide</em>. Immediately before or after an adventure set in Ylraphon, you may spend 5 downtime days guiding hunters, scavengers, and others through the nearest parts of the Flooded Forest. Once during your next game session after this activity, you may inform your DM you are using this benefit to gain advantage on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to jump over an obstacle, climb natural terrain, keep your balance, or avoid falling.</p>

  <summary>Took Too Long: Short Rest Only
</summary><p>You took too long to reach the tower, and do not have enough time to complete it by activating the magical candle you were given at dawn unless you do not take a long rest. Take the benefits of a short rest, then record your current hit points, spell slots, uses of features and traits, and other resources that might be restored to some degree by a long rest. You begin your next adventure in this exact state (subject to any expenditures of downtime or any benefits to gaining a level if you gain one).</p>

<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Took Too Long: Unprotected by the Candle
</summary><p>You took too long to reach the tower, and do not have enough time to complete it by activating the magical candle you were given at dawn unless you do not take a long rest. You can take a long rest, but you do not benefit from the magical candle’s protections against the defenses of the temple. (If you play the adventure <strong>SRCC-01-03</strong> <em>The Altar of the Smoldering Eye</em>, this will be a major disadvantage.)</p>

<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Ylraphon Adventurers Guild
</summary><p>The Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon is a loose-knit league of “dungeoneers, tomb-robbers, errant crusaders, swashbuckling mercenaries, and sundry formidable scalawags of all races and vocations” (according to its charter). It represents adventurers’ interests in town and helps regulate the profitable exploration of the surrounding ruins.</p><p>To initially join the Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon, a character must speak to Jotan Silverhammer, lieutenant guildmaster and volunteer sergeant of the Town Watch. There is no cost if you discovered the cause of the illness affecting the Old City, or if you obtain one of the <strong>Local Pursuit</strong> story awards, due to your substantial contribution to prosperity of the Old City. Otherwise, initial dues are 50 gp, with additional payments of 12 gp a month. These costs are waived, however, for volunteers either who work three shifts a month for the Town Watch. In game terms, this means a character must spend 50 gp to join, and to remain a member, whenever they spend downtime, they must spend an additional 4 gp for every 10 downtime days they spend (though you may be able to substitute downtime for this cost, see below).</p><p>If a character who owes these dues fails to pay them as soon as they spend downtime, they must pay them by the end of their next game session or they lose all benefits of guild membership, and must pay the 50 gp initial dues again to regain them.</p><p>Members of the Adventurers Guild may delve local ruins in search of treasure. They gain access to the <strong>Guild Delving</strong> downtime activity before or after any adventure set in Ylraphon.</p>
