  <summary>Local Pursuit: House Affapanov Militia
</summary><p>Your deeds City have impressed the leaders of House Affapanov, one of the merchant houses that rule Ylraphon, and you have been offered a commission as an officer in their house militia. Immediately before or after an adventure set in Ylraphon, you may spend 5 downtime days on duty training with Zor Serge Affapanov’s military advisor, a blue- horned tiefling and Warlock Knight of Vaasa named Agate. Once during your next game session after this activity, you may inform your DM you are using this benefit to either gain advantage on a single attack roll with a piercing weapon or a cantrip, or on a single Charisma check with a professional soldier or a member of House Affapanov. When you use this benefit on an attack roll, the attack blazes with a violet, starlight glare. <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>You cannot claim this story award if you have another story award that makes you a member of a different house militia in Ylraphon (such as</em> Local Pursuit: House Marsh Militia<em>), and claiming this award prevents you from gaining other such house militia story awards in the future.</em></p>

Choose a name for the tavern and record the name as part of this story award (<em>“Local Pursuit: Part-Time Taverner (Name of Tavern)”</em>). If you wish, you can write down the same tavern name as other characters who take this story award, making them some of your partners.

  <summary>Ylraphon Adventurers Guild
</summary><p>The Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon is a loose-knit league of “dungeoneers, tomb-robbers, errant crusaders, swashbuckling mercenaries, and sundry formidable scalawags of all races and vocations” (according to its charter). It represents adventurers’ interests in town and helps regulate the profitable exploration of the surrounding ruins.</p><p>To initially join the Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon, a character must speak to Jotan Silverhammer, lieutenant guildmaster and volunteer sergeant of the Town Watch. There is no cost if you discovered the cause of the illness affecting the Old City, or if you obtain one of the <strong>Local Pursuit</strong> story awards, due to your substantial contribution to prosperity of the Old City. Otherwise, initial dues are 50 gp, with additional payments of 12 gp a month. These costs are waived, however, for volunteers either who work three shifts a month for the Town Watch. In game terms, this means a character must spend 50 gp to join, and to remain a member, whenever they spend downtime, they must spend an additional 4 gp for every 10 downtime days they spend (though you may be able to substitute downtime for this cost, see below).</p><p>If a character who owes these dues fails to pay them as soon as they spend downtime, they must pay them by the end of their next game session or they lose all benefits of guild membership, and must pay the 50 gp initial dues again to regain them.</p><p>Members of the Adventurers Guild may delve local ruins in search of treasure. They gain access to the <strong>Guild Delving</strong> downtime activity before or after any adventure set in Ylraphon.</p>
