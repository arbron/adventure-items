<p>Civil disorder threatens to throw the leaderless town of Ylraphon into chaos. You find respite from this political strife when the Chiang Emporium hires you for an escort mission. The task: sail south to accompany a Chiang Emporium envoy on a return voyage to Ylraphon, where her wedding is to take place upon her arrival. The voyage is perilous, but not nearly as complicated as what awaits when you finally make it back to town. Part Three of the <em>Whispers Over Ylraphon</em> series.</p>

<h2>Story Awards</h2>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Boon of the Sea Hags
</summary><p>You bargained with sea hags, trading lives or goods for the benefit of those wicked creatures. They promised you a boon of luck, and the hags deliver on that promise: you have received a boon of bad luck.</p><p>The next time you receive a point of Inspiration, it works in reverse, forcing you to roll with Disadvantage when you spend that point of Inspiration. As per the usual rule, you cannot have more than one point of Inspiration at a time, so you must spend any Inspiration you receive before you can get another one.</p><p>Once this happens three times, this boon loses its effect, but the story award remains.</p>

<details class="story-award">

  <summary>Ylraphon Adventurers Guild
</summary><p>The Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon is a loose-knit league of “dungeoneers, tomb-robbers, errant crusaders, swashbuckling mercenaries, and sundry formidable scalawags of all races and vocations” (according to its charter). It represents adventurers’ interests in town and helps regulate the profitable exploration of the surrounding ruins.</p><p>To initially join the Adventurers Guild of Ylraphon, a character must speak to Jotan Silverhammer, lieutenant guildmaster and volunteer sergeant of the Town Watch. There is no cost if you discovered the cause of the illness affecting the Old City, or if you obtain one of the <strong>Local Pursuit</strong> story awards, due to your substantial contribution to prosperity of the Old City. Otherwise, initial dues are 50 gp, with additional payments of 12 gp a month. These costs are waived, however, for volunteers either who work three shifts a month for the Town Watch. In game terms, this means a character must spend 50 gp to join, and to remain a member, whenever they spend downtime, they must spend an additional 4 gp for every 10 downtime days they spend (though you may be able to substitute downtime for this cost, see below).</p><p>If a character who owes these dues fails to pay them as soon as they spend downtime, they must pay them by the end of their next game session or they lose all benefits of guild membership, and must pay the 50 gp initial dues again to regain them.</p><p>Members of the Adventurers Guild may delve local ruins in search of treasure. They gain access to the <strong>Guild Delving</strong> downtime activity before or after any adventure set in Ylraphon.</p>
