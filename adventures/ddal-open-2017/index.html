<h2>Story Awards</h2>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Acererak’s First Victim
</summary><p>You were the first character at the D&amp;D Open to die after the lich Acererak triggered the Soulmonger. This first exposure to the Soulmonger has a strange effect. If your character returns to life, the character has resistance to necrotic energy. The resistance fades away on June 1, 2018.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Adventuring Makes Me Sleepy
</summary><p>You were the first party to take a long rest in the 2017 D&amp;D Open. Your caution and good sense were noted by the powers of this strange place, and you have been temporarily changed by that power. The next time you take a long rest after your current adventure, you receive a prophetic vision from the spirits of Chult. Ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur in your current adventure. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Alive in Death
</summary><p>One of your companions slew a creature and dedicated it to Nanny Pu’Pu. In return, her enchanted green gem brought you back to life. Well…sort of. Your skin and features resemble those of a dead person. You gain the undead creature type, while still retaining your previous creature type. This condition remains for the rest of your character’s life. Undead monsters may ignore you until you attack them, but you have disadvantage of Charisma (Persuasion) checks with humanoid creatures.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Awesome Lunch Meat
</summary><p>You distinguished yourself during the battle with the Giant Tyrannosaurus Rex of Doom! Ubtao is impressed by your cunning. Twice he grants you a boon, allowing you to reroll a failed check. Mark through this certificate when used the second time.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Big Game Hunter
</summary><p>Your team struck the killing blow against the Giant Tyrannosaurus Rex of Doom! Tales of your prowess reach the merchant princes in Port Nyanzaru in Chult, who seek to curry your favor through favorable trade offers, including with other merchants. The next time you visit Fai Chen’s market, you may purchase an item for half of the stated gold piece cost.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Blood for the Trickster Gods
</summary><p>Your party was defeated at least five times by the dangers of Lake Luo’s lost temples. Strangely, this pleased the Trickster Gods of Chult. They watch over you. The next time you are brought to 0 hit points, you are left with 1 hit point instead and you cannot be reduced below 0 hit points until the start of your next turn. Mark through this certificate once it has been spent.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>The Chosen of Chult
</summary><p>When you died in Chult, your soul left your body and was replaced by something ancient and mysterious. You now have the personality of an old and immortal being, but the rest of you is the same. For the rest of this adventure, you are resistant to all piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing damage.</p><p>When the 2017 D&amp;D Open concludes, you lose this resistance. However, some of that immortal soul remains with you. You have advantage on death saves.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Dice Tower Master
</summary><p>You placed first in the Craft (dice tower) Challenge of Ubtao at the D&amp;D Open! If you are reduced to 0 hit points, you may expend this certificate and build a tower out of six different polyhedral dice. As soon as you succeed, your character returns to consciousness with twice your level in hit points.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Explorer of Chult
</summary><p>Your adventures in Chult, for good or woe, are spoken of by the residents of Port Nyanzaru. The bards of Chult sing of our exploits, and those songs may someday reach Baldur’s Gate and beyond. Your fame in Port Nyanzaru makes you a local celebrity. You have advantage on Charisma (Perception) checks with residents and visitors to that port city.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Favor of Ubtao
</summary><p>You have acted with honor, granting the relics of Ubtao to that lost god’s worshippers. When you performed this act of kindness, you received a tattoo in the form of a labyrinth. When you touch the tattoo (no action), you (and only you) gain the benefit of a bless spell for 1 minute. The power of the tattoo dissipates until you take a long rest. Once you reach 11th level, the power of the tattoo fades. Instead, you gain an extra hit point when you gain a level.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Glimpsed Into the Madness of Evil
</summary><p>You have seen into the madness that is about to sweep through Chult. While you have seen an inkling of the doom that is coming, you also are imbued with energy to fight it. While adventuring in Chult, you gain 1 additional hit point per spell level when you are cured by a spell that heals hit point damage. However, your dreams and visions are wracked with the terror that is coming. When you finish a long rest, you regain one less hit die than normal (to a minimum of 1).</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Hated by the Evil Powers of Chult
</summary><p>You have angered Acererak, and you are known to any of the creatures who serve him in Chult. These creatures favor attacking you in a battle. However, your success over their master has imbued you with a certain power. Whenever you take necrotic damage, you can use a reaction to gain resistance to necrotic damage until the start of your next turn. This power refreshes with a short rest.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>I Like to Pace Myself
</summary><p>You were the first party to take 2 short rests in the 2017 D&amp;D Open. Your caution and good sense were noted by the powers of this strange place, and you have been temporarily changed by that power. The next two times you take a long rest after you leave Chult, you double the value of any hit dice you roll during the short rest.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>I Need New Dice
</summary><p>The next two times you roll a 1 on a d20 during an adventure after the D&amp;D Open, you may reroll the d20, taking the second result. Mark through this certificate once it has been spent.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Infested With Evil Spirits
</summary><p>The strange magic of Chult has returned you to life so many times during your adventures that you have been infested with evil spirits. Whenever you reach 0 hit points, one of the evil spirits takes control of you. When you are returned to consciousness, until you take a long rest, you gain the new flaw: “An unpredictable trickster spirit controls my actions.”</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Master of Archery
</summary><p>You placed first in the Archery Competition for the Challenge of Ubtao at the D&amp;D Open! If your character is at disadvantage when making a ranged attack roll, you may expend this certificate to cancel the disadvantage.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Master of Intellect
</summary><p>You placed first in the Intelligence (Mathematics) Challenge of Ubtao at the D&amp;D Open! If you fail a skill check, you may expend this certificate and chose any one die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, or d20) and add the result to the roll. However, if the check fails, you may not use that die (or any die with that same number of sides) for the rest of the encounter.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Master of Senses
</summary><p>You placed first in the Intelligence (Investigation) check for the Challenge of Ubtao at the D&amp;D Open! If your character is blinded, you may close your eyes, roll a die, and guess whether the result is odd or even. If you are incorrect, you may not use this certificate this adventure. If you are correct, mark through this certificate. You are no longer blinded and cannot be blinded for the next 2 minutes.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Maze Runner
</summary><p>You skillfully navigated Ubtao’s maze, completing all of the encounter bonus conditions. Ubtao grants you a boon. When spending Hit Dice, you may expend this certificate to receive the maximum value of any dice rolled during a short rest. Mark through this certificate when used.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Nanny Pu’Pu’s Charm
</summary><p>This character activated Nanny Pu’Pu’s rag doll charm during the adventure. Nanny Pu’Pu has claimed a bit of your soul. The first Wisdom saving throw you make after each long rest is made with disadvantage, as your sleep is wracked with the most horrible nightmares. Your screams and whimpering during sleep make it hard for others around you to rest. However, after a short rest, you gain 1 additional hit point for each Hit Die used.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Raider of the Lost Shrines
</summary><p>You completed all of the bonus conditions for three or more Trickster God shrines! You have a knack for solving puzzles and noticing danger. The next time after this adventure that a trap targets you, any attacks against you automatically miss and you succeed at any skill checks or saving throws due to the trap going off. Mark through this certificate once it has been spent.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Still Standing
</summary><p>Your party survived the second round of the D&amp;D Open without any party member being brought to 0 hit points! Words of your prowess reach the Factions. You may expend this certificate to fulfil the secret mission requirements for Faction Advancement, so long as you meet the other requirements. You may instead expand this certificate to grant this benefit to another character, either your own or another player’s character.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>Ubtao’s Chosen
</summary><p>Your team was one of the first three to complete the cube puzzle, granting access to Ubtao’s sunken temple! Ubtao watches you, and at two times of your choosing, grants you Inspiration. Mark through this certificate once expended.</p>
</details>
<details class="story-award">
  <summary>A Worthy of Ubtao
</summary><p>You were one of the fastest parties to complete Ubtao’s challenge. For your wisdom and cunning, you start with inspiration in the next five adventures or story chapters you play.</p>
