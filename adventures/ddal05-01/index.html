She is, however, the size of a small housecat. She cannot attack, defend, distract, aid, or otherwise play any role in combat. She can be taught to do simple tricks if treated well and if you spend 20 down time days training her.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Friend of Prrrt</summary><p>You helped alleviate the suffering of a galeb duhr named Prrrt. It tells others of its kind of your kindness, garnering you a positive reputation among elemental earth creatures. As an action, you can attempt a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince earth creatures of the elemental type not to attack you. As long as you do not attack the creature or other elemental earth creatures, it targets others. This, however, does not protect your allies. You lose this story aware if you attack or otherwise harm an elemental earth creature.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Victim of Greed</summary><p>You were stung by greed, and your soul has been infected by the deadly sin.

This can be removed with a <em>remove curse</em>.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Hated by Giants</summary><p>You unwisely removed one of the sacred plates of Annam from his shrine. You are now cursed. Giants who see you know that you have offended the greatest of their gods, and they target you before your allies in a fight. They also have advantage on attacks against you. This can be removed with a <em>remove curse</em>. You also have possession of one or more plates, but no one seems to want to buy them from you.</p></details><details class="story-award"><summary>Friend of Kraddokk</summary><p>You talked with the storm giant Kraddokk and did not desecrate the shrine of Annam.
