        <div class="content"><section><h1>Durlag's Tower</h1><p>East of Beregost, nestled in the outskirts of the Wood of Sharp Teeth, Durlag’s Tower has intrigued and yet stymied adventurers for decades. Stuffed full of mechanical traps and arcane wards, and rumored to be inhabited by fiends, very few have managed to extract any REAL treasure from the former home of Durlag Trollkiller. However, a powerful item in the ancient fight against the giants is said to be housed there, and the cloud giant Baron Rajiram has committed significant resources toward recovering it. After a pleasant tea in her garden, SEER calls upon you to beat him there and put a stop to his efforts!</p><p>A Four-Hour Adventure for 11th–16th level Characters.</p><h2>Items</h2><p><ul><li>Staff of Thunder and Lightning <em>very rare</em></li><li>Quasit's Essence <em>unique</em></li><li>1 x Potion of Giant Strength (Frost) <em>rare</em></li><li>1 x Potion of Invulnerability <em>rare</em></li><li>1 x Potion of Speed <em>very rare</em></li><li>1 x Potion of Superior Healing <em>rare</em></li><li>1 x Spell Scroll of Greater Invisibility <em>rare</em></li></ul></p><h2>Story Awards</h2><details><summary>Favor of SEER</summary><p>If the characters choose to not sell the jade dagger, they may instead turn it over to SEER. If they do, they all earn her admiration, as this very dagger was lost during an expedition that, in her words, “went poorly”. The blade is a family heritage item and all that remains of her long-lost uncle, whom she refuses to name directly. SEER is willing to provide a character that has this story award with one spell scroll of second level or lower. If the character is a member of the Lords’ Alliance, they can instead choose a spell scroll of up to third level. If the character is a member of the Lords’ Alliance and is rank four or higher, they may instead choose a spell scroll of level 3 or lower and also receive a <em>potion of heroism</em>. Any spell chosen for this reward must be on the wizard spell list and cannot be a ritual. Once a reward is chosen, strike out this story award.</p></details><details><summary>Traitor to Your Faction</summary><p>Lords’ Alliance and Zhentarim faction members that falsified evidence of their missions or failed their missions suffer a terrible blow to their reputation. After this adventure, the character must forfeit the next two renown points that they would gain; once this forfeiture is complete, strike out this story award.</p></details><details><summary>Vergadain’s Firespirits</summary><p>Vergadain, a dwarven deity of wealth and trickery, was known for his favored drink; as clear as water and smelled of honey and cane sugar, but was in truth an incredibly potent liquor that put standard dwarven spirits to shame. He would sometimes challenge unknowing humans and elves to drinking contents, where he would slyly swap in sweetened water while his opponent would down drink after drink of this highly-flammable liquid. It rarely ended well for them. And now you have the recipe!</p><p>You may spend 60 downtime days to craft one barrel of firespirits. Each batch requires special sweet herbs from Bitter-root’s copse near Durlag’s Tower and 100 gp worth of other materials, including aged dwarven spirits blessed by a dwarven priest. If you find yourself in possession of campaign documentation that bestows ownership of a distillery, this time and gold cost is reduced by half.</p><p>Each barrel contains approximately 30 gallons of firespirits, and can be sold for 1,000 gp. Alternately, as this is a rare elixir; it may be worth a significant amount to Fai Chen, certain high-ranking lords, or other purveyors of such fineries. Additionally, if you give a nip of firespirits (just a wee one) to a dwarf, all Charisma (Persuasion) checks made with them are made with advantage for the next hour.</p></details></section></div>
