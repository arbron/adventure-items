<h3>
  <a href="/adventures/dc-poa-gsp02-01h">The Arrival of Mr. Sorrow</a>
  <em class="adventure-code">DC-PoA-GSP02-01H</em></h3>
<p>The town of Good Mead is about to select its new town speaker after the last one was killed by a giant. However, an eladrin has joined the election at the last minute, promising that he and his men know how to stop the Everlasting Rime.</p>
<h3>
  <a href="/adventures/dc-poa-gsp02-02h">The Priest of Caer-Dineval</a>
  <em class="adventure-code">DC-PoA-GSP02-02H</em></h3>
<p>A gnome priest of Lathander wearing tattered vestment and broken manacles has been found in Caer-Dineval. The priest, who is a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, seems unaffected by the cold. What’s more fascinating is that it looks like it has seen something it shouldn’t. Now, what would that be?</p>
<h3>
  <a href="/adventures/dc-poa-gsp02-03h">That Ain’t Mead</a>
  <em class="adventure-code">DC-PoA-GSP02-03H</em></h3>
<p>A caravan transporting mead to Easthaven has gone missing. The Zhentarim merchants who have placed the order were very demanding in retrieving their mead and willing to pay more just to get it all back. Sounds pretty suspicious.</p>
<h3>
  <a href="/adventures/dc-poa-gsp02-04h">The Horror Sphere</a>
  <em class="adventure-code">DC-PoA-GSP02-04H</em></h3>
<p>A black pearl the size of a human head has been discovered by adventurers and has been brought to Lonelywood. However, whoever has the pearl immediately dies as soon as they see a goat. Somebody needs to put it back where it was found! But what does the Lords' Alliance have to do with all of this?</p></div>
