<p>New allies in the Underdark have emerged and are key to stopping drow slave-taking raids around the Moonsea.

  <em class="adventure-code">CCC-MTL-03</em></h3>
<p>Are you ready to turn the tables and enact a devious ambush against drow slavers? Do you want to visit a tavern run by an illithid? Have a run in with a dwarf battlerager? This is your chance! The simmering conflict between the freedom fighters of House Tor’Erhyl and the Lolth-serving slavers of House Ouss’Nassath has reached its boiling point. Following the recent assassination of a sword dancer, Matron Tor’Erhyl makes a bold plan to strike back where it hurts most—the slave shipments. Yet this not merely a mission of vengeance—it’s one of mercy and liberation.</p>

<p>Zim Von Zeam—of ZVZ Caravans—has spent his life braving the lawless lands of Thar with his caravans. Now, life has gifted him with a new opportunity–establishing a trade route from Melvaunt to nothing less than an Underdark city. Does he have what it takes to deal with the treacherous drow? Zim’s ambition is an adventuring opportunity like no other. Can you prove yourselves worthy in a test of combat prowess against elite drow troops and their cunning commander?</p>

<p>The body of a strange elf is discovered on the shores of Moonsea. Efforts to identify its origin lead to a sea bound expedition to the home of the sea elves. Elsewhere, an ambitious merchant sets upon the deadly task of establishing a trade route to nothing less than an Underdark city. His journey is destined to take him across the subterranean Moondeep Sea aboard a drow ship. Where the two seas meet, secrets hide and adventure begins.</p>
<h3>

<p>Drow slave-taking raids near Melvaunt have slowed thanks to the continuing

alliance is an unprecedented chance to attend a grand gala within the drow
city of Zethlentyn Prime.
